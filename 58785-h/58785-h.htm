<h1>THE GRAY ANGELS</h1>

<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

<p>The younger generation of Birge’s Corners insisted
that nothing exciting had happened since Abigail Clergy’s
love affair in 1867, and the older generation retorted that
Thurley Precore, who must have been born in Arcadia,
was bound to create excitement.</p>

<p>The older generation were content to have time snail
over their doorsteps. To their placid minds much had
happened and was happening to content any one of normal
makeup. Take the Hotel Button—what more did
any one want than that two-story establishment with ramshackle
outbuildings and a crazy wooden fence about the
whole of it? Commercial travellers making the town
annually never complained about Prince Hawkins’ hospitality
or Mrs. Prince Hawkins’ cooking—never. And
during one of those comical cold spells, when twenty below
zero was registered on the thermometer, the younger generation
were mighty glad to end a sleigh ride before the
Hotel Button, and have one of Mrs. Prince Hawkins’
oyster suppers—she had been Lena Button, an only
child, and her working like a slave now ...! Also,
the upstairs parlor with its flowered carpet and tortured
walnut furniture and the same square piano on which
Lena Button had learned her “Battle of Prague”—the
younger generation never thought of refusing the upstairs
parlor in which to have a wind-up dance. None of them
complained about the slowness of Birge’s Corners—until
the next day!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span></p>

<p>As for stores: there was Oyster Jim’s confectionery
store with a balcony overlooking Lake Birge, and here
the younger generation gathered to eat ice cream and
drink cream soda. Of course, Oyster Jim’s store was not
like New York tea-rooms which some of the younger
generation had visited and drawn unkind comparisons
about, but the ice cream was homemade, and, if he did
dilute the cream, the water from Lake Birge was about
as good as there was in the state; a chemist had said so.
Besides, Oyster Jim’s other specialty was canary birds,
yellow-throated songsters in every corner of the balcony,
and it took a pretty smart man to keep an ice cream store
and raise canary birds, to say nothing of selling Ford supplies
to distressed tourists! Then there was Submit
Curler’s general store. She was always taking magazines
to keep “up to snuff”—and as for patterns of
ginghams and calicos, there were no prettier patterns
to be had. When the younger generation said <em>why</em> did
Miss Curler insist on selling horse whips and lanterns and
year-old hard candies and marbles and soft soap and
acorn picture frames and knitted things she made in between
rings of the bell, and why didn’t she have decent
silk waists and neckties and stop calling you by your
first name long after your engagement had been announced,
to say nothing of wrapping things in newspapers
and expecting you to carry them through the streets—the
older generation sniffed in answer that Submit Curler
was one of God’s own, and, although Algebra might have
been the capital of a foreign country as far as she knew,
she had crooned countless teething babies to sleep to give
their mothers a rest, and helped lay out the dead and
then stayed “behind” to have a piping hot dinner ready
when the mourners “came back.”</p>

<p>Of course the younger generation were not silenced by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
this. They began a complaint about the weekly paper,
a ridiculous affair running three-year-old detective serials
and month-old national happenings, telling whose veranda
was to be painted and who had bought a pair of new earlaps!
To which the older generation magnanimously remarked
that, as long as “Ali Baba” and Betsey Pilrig
had their health, there would be no need for an up-to-date
daily newspaper. One did not have to wait until news
was gathered, edited and printed. Ali Baba, Abby
Clergy’s coachman, and Betsey Pilrig, who lived in the
yellow house across from Thurley Precore’s box-car
wagon, kept the village informed of every happening in
such rapid-fire fashion that the need for a daily sheet was
never experienced!</p>

<p>Granting this—where was there any society? To
which the older generation answered, indignantly, that
nowhere in the United States of America <span class="smcapuc">HAD</span> there
existed such society, elegance and grandeur as at the summer
colony on Birge’s Lake, and, if those days were contemporary
with Abigail Clergy’s great sorrow, what mattered
it? The aroma of past grandeur lingers long, and
even yet the stately mansions with endless turrets and
towers stood about the shores of the lake causing one
to respect their closed shutters.</p>

<p>To this the younger generation, although protesting
that the society was entirely a memory, had no reply.
For the older generation had spoken the truth. About
the perfect little lake, an emerald in its coloring and
flanked by pungent pine woods and an amphitheater of
tiny hills, some half a century before, had been built the
summer homes of the oldest of America’s aristocracy.
In those days when Birge’s Corners was but a post
office and a few stray dogs, the lake had been an oasis
for the tired rich; here families came to grow tanned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
and rosy, while love affairs ripened and wedding bells
were listened for and the elders sat back in pleased
approval. The rich owned the lake, so the saying went—but
Daniel Birge owned the Corners and the rich!
Daniel Birge was steward to the rich. If they desired an
improvement in the way of carriage sheds or certain
grades of merchandise which were daily necessities, Daniel
Birge, founder of Birge’s Corners, saw to it that it
was accomplished. The lake had been named for his
great-great-grandfather, who discovered it, and, when
the richest of the rich suggested that “Birge’s Lake” was
a trifle commonplace name for such a bit of paradise—“Fairy
Lake” would be more appropriate—they met
their Waterloo. This was the only thing Daniel Birge
refused the rich—the re-naming of the little lake.</p>

<p>“Great-great-grandpap found it, and it’ll keep his
name,” was all he said.</p>

<p>And because Dan Birge “had a way with him”—even
as his grandson, the present Dan Birge, had a “way with
him”—the summer colony never questioned the matter
again. Birge’s Lake and Birge’s Corners were christened
for eternity.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, middle class inhabitants came to live at
the Corners, houses multiplied from season to season, the
Hotel Button came into existence, as did rival blacksmiths’
shops and Submit Curler’s store. Even a travelling
dentist took rooms at Betsey Pilrig’s for every Thursday,
and the Methodist and Baptist churches ran a race
as to the height of their steeples.</p>

<p>Time soon enough changed the ways and the likings of
the rich. The old homes came to be rented out or closed
for two and three years at a time. Some were put on the
market, but no one ever bought them. Well-built mansions
they were, with twenty and thirty rooms and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
grounds extending back for half an acre, stables with
rooms for the coachman’s family, private boat landings,
romantic rustic arbors where tea used to be served, and
summer houses with lacey latticework where débutantes
gathered to read Tennyson and their own love letters.</p>

<p>Birge’s Corners built up so rapidly that the decline of
Birge’s Lake was scarcely noticed. One by one the families
stopped coming to the lake for the summer. There
were newer, more luxurious or more isolated places—their
younger generation complained of the lack of thrilling
events. The “ghost village” it was truthfully
called, house after house lying idle, save for stray sparrows
or squirrels who burrowed snugly in the eaves.</p>

<p>“Ali Baba”—Joshua Maples in writing—was made
general caretaker. One by one the families left him in
charge of the ghost mansions. He knew just which room
it was where the Confederate captain married the Boston
belle, and how many roses had been used in the decorations.
He could tell the exact spot in the Luddington
house where young Luddington had shot himself—the
night before his theft of bank funds should be made public.</p>

<p>A stranger could not point at any of the deserted mansions
but what Ali Baba, taking off his tattered hat and
scratching his white, curly head philosophically, would
summon a word picture of the past, when the curly head
had been black and the wrinkled face smooth and boyish.</p>

<p>“They say society has all gone to live at Newport
in the summer,” Ali Baba would summarize. “Well,
mebbe they has. All I know is this—that right here
at Birge’s Lake from 1860 to 1890—for nigh thirty
years, there wasn’t no place in the land that could boast
of entertaining any finer. We’ve had three presidents
come fishing—right there by that landing—and Patti<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
sang ‘The Last Rose of Summer’ in that big house over
there—the one with the gables. I passed the punch
afterwards—yes, sir, right up to time I was, in a new
dress suit Major McAndrews bought me. I never
heard nobody sing as she did—and the wimmen said her
pink satin train was six feet long. Well, I’ll take that
back—I have heard it sung as good and mebbe better
by a girl right in this village—a nightingale girl named
Thurley Precore.</p>

<p>“That Swiss cha-<em>lay</em> over there was built in 1878 by
Hugo Fiske—he and his bride were going to come
here summers—she died the day before the wedding,
and he come on here, as soon as she was buried, and
stayed all alone, his wedding bags and finery stacked in
the hall and never unpacked. He kept trampin’,
trampin’, trampin’ through the woods and around the
lake, never speakin’ to a soul. By and by, when he had
walked it all out, he come to the livery and asked to be
taken to the train. I happened to be handy then, and so
I drove him over. When I helped him out and toted his
bags, he says to me, ‘Ali Baba, tell Abby Clergy I understand’—and
he never come back again.”</p>

<p>Here the old man would become uncommunicative,
and, when the stranger would idly ask, “Who was Abby
Clergy?”—all the answer would be was:</p>

<p>“His neighbor.”</p>

<p>Then the stranger might suggest the danger of burglars.
To which Ali Baba would answer:</p>

<p>“I guess you don’t know these parts—oh, we got a
few burglars—robins and chipmunks and that kind.”</p>

<p>If the stranger asked “Why are you called Ali Baba?”
looking with interest at his rosy old face, Ali Baba would
bid him good-by without further ado and make his way
homeward, past Birge’s Corners to Birge’s Lake to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
certain red brick mansion, with every shuttered window
fastened tight, save those at the back, and the gleam
of lights showing from upper front windows. Ali Baba
would find his way to the back of the house, tiptoeing
meekly inside an immaculate summer kitchen to find his
widowed sister, Hopeful Whittier, to whom he would
say:</p>

<p>“Land sakes and Mrs. Davis, I got talkin’ again over
to Oyster Jim’s—a fellow in one of those gosh-darn
leather coats—seems to me he never would stop askin’
questions!”</p>

<p>Hopeful, stern and forbidding in her slate-colored
calico, would answer, “Ali Baba, do you know Miss
Abby has been waiting—it is <span class="smcapuc">PAST</span> four o’clock?”</p>

<p>Without delay Ali Baba would rush to the barn and in
magical order arrange a shining, old-style harness on an
iron gray mare, hitch the same to an old-style, closed
coupé padded with scarlet silk, shades of past glory! On
the coupé door was a monogram—A. C., entwined with
plumes and fleur-de-lis. Donning a black frock coat and
silk hat, both slightly green when the sun met them unexpectedly,
Ali Baba would mount the coach seat, and, with
a grave “Come on, Melba,” to the mare, would cause
her to stalk sedately out of the barn, down the gravel
path to the side porch where the carved door would open
and a peculiar little person, seemingly very old, would
step outside. She would be dressed in a long out-of-date
black coat and a round, felt hat fastened under her chin
by an elastic. Her shoes would be rough and shabby,
and her gray hair betray itself as fastened in an unbecoming
“button” under her hat. As she would put one
hand on the coupé door, it would show itself to be yellowed
and feeble. She never wore gloves, but the most
beautiful rings in the world sparkled innocently on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
small fingers, pigeon blood rubies, white water diamonds,
a black pearl, emeralds and sapphires, and on her thumb
was a great cameo ring held in place by a jewelled guard.</p>

<p>Around this small person’s neck would be a thick, old-style
braided watch chain, at the end of which dangled
glassless, gold lorgnettes which she never used. As she
lifted her face to Ali Baba’s respectfully inclining ear
to say the same phrase she had said for thirty-five years—“An
hour’s drive, Ali Baba, not too fast,”—one
could see that she had dark, restless eyes and a thin,
sharp face, a flexible mouth drawn into a melancholy
expression and a bulging forehead bespeaking more
brains than are usual.</p>

<p>The coupé door would close and down would come the
faded scarlet curtains. Ali Baba, laying the whip a full
eight inches above Melba’s iron-gray back, would then
effect a triumphant exit out of the driveway.</p>

<p>So it was that Miss Clergy, sole occupant of the ghost
village, drove at four each day of the year, rain or shine,
save when the snow piled too high to let the old-fashioned
sledge proceed. “An hour’s drive, Ali Baba, not too
fast” had become a village slogan.</p>

<p>No one ever questioned Ali Baba concerning Miss
Clergy, or commented on the appearance of the coupé
with its white-haired driver and curtained occupant, until,
in the year nineteen hundred and twelve, something else
<em>very</em> thrilling happened in Birge’s Corners, something
which made Abigail Clergy’s love tragedy seem remote,
scarcely worth remembering.</p>

<p>The person concerned in the event had been told the
real story of Abigail Clergy, and why Joshua Maples was
called “Ali Baba,” and why Miss Clergy drove at four,
always alone and with the curtains drawn, and why the
children were afraid of her and called her witch, trying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
to make their mothers admit that the Clergy house was
haunted. That person was Thurley Precore—born in
Arcadia, the Corners admitted, although they did not call
it by that name. They said, “Wherever Thurley Precore
managed to get that smile and face and voice of
hers and to sing more and more like an angel when every
one knew—” and so forth and so on, the deduction arrived
at being that God had let Himself realize His
dream of beauty when He created Thurley Precore—Thurley
with the most worthless, indifferent parents
about whom the Corners had ever heard tell.</p>

<p>Thurley was twenty when the “thrilling event” happened.
But her advent into the Corners ten years before
is worth recording. To the older generation, in fact, it
had been a happening of great interest, and, had it not
taken place, the really thrilling event in 1912 could never
have occurred. But younger generations never consider
the law of cause and effect, so they shrugged their shoulders
in impatience when their elders insisted on re-telling
to out-of-town visitors how Thurley Precore first “sang
for her supper.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

<p>There had driven into the stableyard of the Hotel
Button a queer box-car wagon on rickety yellow wheels,
unwillingly pulled by tired nags. The wagon had a
hope-to-die roof and a smokestack. On the driver’s seat
was a ragged man and an impetuous young person in
faded blue gingham. The impetuous young person was
driving and singing “God Be With Us Till We Meet
Again”—unconscious of the beauty of her voice.</p>

<p>Her father nodded approval, as the song ended and
the wagon halted before the stable door. As the story
goes, young Dan Birge and Lorraine McDowell, the
minister’s only child, were playing hop-scotch in imminent
danger of the horses’ feet. They paused to stare at the
newcomers. The young person had begun in businesslike
fashion:</p>

<p>“I want to speak to the pro-pry-e-tor. My name is
Thurley, Thurley Precore, and this is my dad. He’s
awful sick. We come all the way from Boulder, out in
Colorado—I guess you don’t know where that is, but it’s
miles ’n’ miles from here. My ma is sick, too,—she’s
lyin’ down inside, and she’ll have to see a doctor right off.
Where is the pro-pry-e-tor? Ain’t you listening to me?
We sell tinware—why, say, our pots and pans can’t be
beat—nor matched. Even the gypsies said so when we
camped with ’em at Lisbon, Ohio. Isn’t it so, pa?”
turning her flushed, lovely face to the man beside her.</p>

<p>“I guess if you says it is—it is,” he chuckled.
“Ladies and gentlemen,” he added to the astonishment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
of the boy and girl, “what Thurley says goes—she’s
been runnin’ this family for enough years to prove that
she kin,” the chuckle ended in a hollow cough.</p>

<p>Then, the wretched lace-curtained window was pushed
open, and a woman’s faded face appeared, a vapid, senseless
face with dyed blond hair and china-doll blue eyes; a
wisp of pink ribbon showed about her drawn throat.</p>

<p>“Dear me, Cornelius, don’t stand here all day,” she
began fretfully. “Thurley, come right inside and git on
some decent duds. I guess folks think, because we’re
travellin’ in a wagon, that we ain’t no better than gypsies—well,
every one has their high days <span class="smcapuc">AND</span> their low
ones. If my father could see me now!” Her thin hands
loaded with cheap rings lifted into view and twelve-year-old
Daniel Birge, counted as the gallows’ brightest prospect,
nudged Lorraine McDowell, the only girl he ever
played with—because his father made him—until they
both laughed.</p>

<p>“Of all the bringin’ up!” floated out in thin, melancholy
tones. “Cornelius, are you goin’ to set there like
a bump on a log and have me laffed at?”</p>

<p>But Thurley had jumped down and with clenched fists
approached Daniel and Lorraine. She paused, womanlike,
to give vent to her opinion before she should strike.
Just then Prince Hawkins and his wife and Betsey Pilrig
and her lame grandchild, Philena, gathered as spectators.</p>

<p>They said afterwards that all the devils in the world
seemed flashing from the strange child’s blue eyes. She
was barefoot and ragged; her dress far too short for her
long-legged, awkward self, and her mop of brown hair
in a disorderly braid. But she had a fine, strong body,
despite the ragged dress, and, although she possessed not
a single regular feature, there was a prophecy of true
greatness in her face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>Daniel and Lorraine stared at the brown, clenched
fists. They were the ordinary, well-dressed, well-nourished
children to be seen in such a backwoods town as
Birge’s Corners.</p>

<p>“Now you laff again,” Thurley commanded. “Laff—go
on—let me hear you. I want to tell you I got a
sick pa and ma, and we certainly have played hard luck
all the way from Boulder, Colorado. I guess, if you had
any manners, you’d not laff at us. Not if we do peddle
tinware and tell fortunes by tea leaves. We ain’t always
done it, and we ain’t always goin’ to. But we’re in hard
luck—don’t you understand? And don’t you dare to
laff when my ma talks or call us gypsies. We’re white
folks, but we’re just a little bit discouraged,” her angry
voice betrayed a quiver.</p>

<p>The others had gathered nearer to hear what was being
said, looking up at the driver’s seat to where the wreck of
a man sat smoking his corn-cob pipe, secure in the defense
established by his small virago.</p>

<p>“I tell you right now,” Thurley’s mother supplemented,
“that, when I had my health and was on the
stage, I could have bought and sold the whole town. My
father was a real Kentucky colonel, and I was brought up
to never lift a finger—”</p>

<p>At which Thurley’s father took his pipe from his mouth
long enough to say, “Shut up, Jen; let the kid give it to
’em—she knows how.”</p>

<p>Thurley took up the burden of defense. “We want
the pro-pry-e-tor. We want to camp here to-night, and
get some vittles and we’ll give him the loveliest new
tins—as bright as silver. Where is the pro-pry-e-tor?”</p>

<p>Prince Hawkins and his wife, taking pity on the child,
came to her rescue.</p>

<p>“Oh, pshaw, I don’t believe we want none of them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
tins!” Mrs. Hawkins said. “We got more now than we
ever use.”</p>

<p>Tears gathered in Thurley’s eyes. She turned her
head so they would remain a secret.</p>

<p>“Maybe you’d like your fortunes told?” suggested
Mrs. Precore from the window ledge. “Honest, I certainly
have told some remarkable things—why, a Chicago
finan-seer wanted me to settle in Chicago so he could
get my advice as to the stock exchange—” Here she
gave way to coughing and vanished completely.</p>

<p>“My ma and pa is too sick to work,” Thurley added,
determined to gain her point. “I got to get a doctor for
them to-morrow. We was headin’ for a city, but we sort
of run out of supplies—” She bit her underlip.</p>

<p>“Maybe you’d like a stewpan?” she coaxed of Betsey
Pilrig.</p>

<p>“Take it, granny,” Philena whispered.</p>

<p>“Lemme see it,” Betsey answered.</p>

<p>Thurley tore inside the wagon to re-appear with a
motley collection of flimsy tins, bent and battered from
their long journey.</p>

<p>A titter ran around the crowd. With the courage
born of despair Thurley threw back her head and cried
out, “Well, then, if nobody wants to buy anything—I
kin sing for our supper!”</p>

<p>“All right, you poor lamb,” Mrs. Prince Hawkins
answered, “sing for us, and we’ll see that you get a good
hot supper.”</p>

<p>Thurley’s father took his pipe out of his mouth again
to say, “She kin sing, ma’am.”</p>

<p>So Thurley, mounting a step of the wagon, began “Believe
Me, If All Those Endearing Young Charms,” the
sun shining on her dark head, lighting up unexpected
glints of Titian red. A passing teamster paused to listen,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
and applauded when she had finished, and the circle of
critics were awed and quiet. For the ragged child seemed
to vanish; she was merely the instrument for the glorious
voice unhampered by artificial notions. Thurley sang as
she had always done, winning for the inefficient parents—“life’s
sinking ships,” some one had called them—their
food and keep.</p>

<p>“Sing us another, and you can stay another day,”
Prince Hawkins called out as the applause ceased.</p>

<p>Thurley responded graciously with:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">There was an old man and he had a wooden leg,</div>
<div class="verse">He had no tobacco, nor tobacco could he beg.</div>
<div class="verse">Another old man had a wooden box,</div>
<div class="verse">And he always kept tobacco in the old tobacco box.</div>
<div class="verse">Said the first old man, “Gimme a chew.”</div>
<div class="verse">Said the second old man, “Durned if I do.</div>
<div class="verse">Take my advice and save up your rocks</div>
<div class="verse">And you’ll always have tobacco in the old tobacco box!”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“I know dozens,” she announced happily, as she
hopped down on to the ground, “but, if you don’t mind,
I’d rather have supper now and sing some more to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Drive into that shed,” Prince Hawkins told her.
“You come around to the kitchen—I guess your pa can
unhitch, can’t he?”</p>

<p>Thurley laughed. “Dear, no—makes him cough—he’s
got a pain in his side, too. I sang four songs in the
last town for painkiller, but it didn’t do him any good—over
there, pa, dear—I’ll be with you in a minnit.” She
watched the rickety wagon creak towards the shed.</p>

<p>Betsey Pilrig and Philena crowded about Thurley.
“Is your mother awful sick, too?” Betsey asked.</p>

<p>Thurley nodded. “Always been sick—guess she always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
will be. Pa has been sick, too—ever since I remember
anything.”</p>

<p>“Where are their folks?” Mrs. Hawkins demanded.
“Somebody ought to look after them!”</p>

<p>“Guess they haven’t any,” Thurley answered easily.
“Guess they’re all dead—or something.”</p>

<p>She looked reproachfully at Daniel and Lorraine, who
had retreated several feet away. “Guess you won’t laff
again,” she said imperiously.</p>

<p>She passed them with an absurd swagger, and a moment
later they saw her unhitching the tired nags with
the dexterity of a groom.</p>

<p>“I swan,” Mrs. Hawkins said to Betsey Pilrig, “that
mite carin’ for those worthless beggars—gettin’ her to
sell their old pans—did you ever see such blue eyes and
did you ever, ever hear any one sing like that? She’ll be
famous, if she don’t starve to death takin’ care of them
first!”</p>

<p>“Granny,” said Philena Pilrig,—being lame Philena
never played with other children—“I love that little
girl; ask her to come see me.”</p>

<p>“She don’t have time for visiting, I guess,” her grandmother
answered. “We’ll send her something nice to
eat; she’d rather have that.”</p>

<p>Behind the woodpile Daniel and Lorraine were talking
it over.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry I laughed,” Lorraine said penitently.
“You made me—my father don’t let me laugh at poor
folks.”</p>

<p>“Because he’s a minister—I laughed because it was
funny,” Dan retorted, his dark eyes flashing, “and I bet
now that—what’s her name?—Thurley would have
laughed too, if she could have looked in a glass and seen
herself. I like her. I bet <em>she</em> wouldn’t cry, if she got<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
lost in the woods.” This with a reproachful expression.</p>

<p>Lorraine moved nearer him. “Dan, I didn’t really
cry; I was just nervous. Maybe I can do things this girl
can’t; anyhow, I don’t go around in a ragged dress and
my hair all rumpled,” and she smoothed the pattern of
her pink frock proudly. She was fair-haired with dove-colored
eyes and tiny, dainty features.</p>

<p>Dan did not answer. Lorraine touched his arm.
“Are you mad?” she whispered earnestly.</p>

<p>“Not mad, but you know, Lorraine, I only play with
you because my father makes me—because your father’s
the minister and pa thinks it looks well.” Daniel possessed
the aggressive frankness of the Birge family, but
he had not acquired their customary diplomacy.</p>

<p>Lorraine’s underlip quivered. “Wouldn’t you play
with me, unless I was?” she asked wistfully. “I always
liked you best of every one.”</p>

<p>Daniel stared at her in contempt. “I like you—but
you’re a girl, and I like the gang better—I bet though
that now—what was it?—Thurley—I bet Thurley
would be one of the gang, as if she were a fellow.”</p>

<p>“So you like that ragged girl?” Lorraine asked in
alarm.</p>

<p>Dan nodded. “When she sang, my heart beat loud,
and she looked at me more’n she did the rest. I’m going
to tell her I’m sorry I laughed.”</p>

<p>Lorraine turned to leave him. “My father won’t
want me playing with you, Dan, even if your great-great-great-grandfather
did discover the lake and your father
has money. Everybody knows your father has a gambling
room and sells beer on Sunday—now! And if you
play with a tin peddler’s girl, my father won’t let me
play with you—tra-la-la—” She began singing shrilly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>“If I was you, I wouldn’t try to sing after what we’ve
just heard,” Dan flung back defiantly, “and, when your
father wants a new roof on his old church or another
carpet, he’ll be glad enough to take my father’s saloon
money.”</p>

<p>With which they parted, Lorraine repairing to the
parsonage with her budget of woes, and Dan striding
across to the box-car wagon, to knock at the door.</p>

<p>Thurley’s mother appeared. “What is it, boy?” she
demanded fretfully. “Dear me, I was napping and you
woke me up with such a start my head aches. Thurley,
here’s that boy that laffed.”</p>

<p>Dan took the opportunity to peer inside the wagon.
To his mind such an existence would be unquestionably
jolly, traveling, traveling, traveling, with no school, no
rules or regulations whatsoever. He had a good mind
to bind himself out to the Precore family then and there,
despite the fact of being Daniel Birge’s only child and the
wealthiest boy in the place, as his father often told him.</p>

<p>Inside the wagon was a rude partition. Thurley was
busied with something in the front. The stock in trade of
tins lined the walls, jangling discordantly on the slightest
provocation. Faded stage photographs in plush frames
punctuated the row of cakepans from the stewing kettles,
and between the stewing kettles and the frying pans were
some of Thurley’s contraptions—hand-colored “ladies,”
which she had cut from fashion books or magazines and
pasted on the wall. There was a rickety lounge with a
red velvet “throw,” and an attempt at an easy chair, a
tiny oil stove and a wretched cupboard which resembled
Mother Hubbard’s concerning contents. Scraps of carpet
were on the floor, a packing trunk held the Precore
wardrobe. An alarm clock minus one hand, but ticking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
bravely, a copy of “Dreams and Premonitions,” a palm
leaf fan, an old accordion, some greasy playing cards,
whiskey bottles, kerosene lamps, a green penholder without
any point and a few yellow-backed novels were the
ornaments. The other side of the partition was evidently
sleeping quarters.</p>

<p>Thurley appeared to demand indignantly, “Well—going
to laff again?”</p>

<p>“Come outside,” Dan ordered, looking darkly at
Thurley’s mother.</p>

<p>Thurley followed, her mother flopping down on the
lounge and calling to Cornelius to bring her some tea.</p>

<p>Outside the wagon Daniel halted, coming up close to
Thurley and adopting a confidential tone of voice.</p>

<p>“I’m Daniel Birge,” he said. “My great-great-great-grandfather
discovered this lake, and I guess you’ll hear
all about our family if you stay here long enough. My
father owns that brick building down there. It’s a saloon
and a blacksmith shop and a real estate office all in
one. Ain’t that awful?” This with a boy grimace.
“When I’m a man, it’s going to be a big department
store. All the good folks in this town expect to see me
go to hell.” Being the only boy officially allowed to
swear, Dan waited for her to be shocked.</p>

<p>But Thurley settled herself on the steps of the wagon,
hugging her long legs up under her. “I suppose
there’ll be some nice people in hell,” she commented by
way of comfort.</p>

<p>Daniel drew out a sheet of paper. “I’m going to
have Ali Baba print this in big letters on a card and stick
it up over the barn, but maybe it would show better if I
put it on your wagon—’cause everybody will come to see
that, and so they’d see my card.”</p>

<p>Thurley read the offered paper:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">Big Show to-morrow in D. Birge’s barn<br />
D. Birge manager<br />
Peple our age—ten pins. Children—five pins<br />
See the great swinging man<br />
and<br />
Mising link.<br />
Come early—but one performance so why mis it?</p>

<p>“Are you twelve years old?” was all Thurley commented,
handing it back.</p>

<p>Dan nodded. “Can’t I put it on your wagon, Thurley?”
He spoke her name softly, as if uncertain of his
right.</p>

<p>“You haven’t spelled people nor missing as it is in
books,” she corrected, a small finger pointing out his
errors.</p>

<p>“What difference does that make? Folks know what
you mean. As long as you make folks know what you
mean, you don’t have to waste time learning how to spell
and that truck—my father don’t make me go to school,
no siree, not if I don’t want to go; he never went much
nor his father nor his father nor his father!” he asserted.
“We just about own the Corners, too. There ain’t anybody
for miles around that dares sass my father. We
started the rich folks coming to this lake, and we got a
lot of their trade, and my father can buy any man in this
town and then tell him where to get off—even the minister—so
there! What’s the good of spelling words
right?”</p>

<p>For the first time in his life, however, Dan seemed
anxious to meet with approval. When he told the gang
his opinions, they listened respectfully, for did not Dan
Birge have hip-boots and a bicycle with a coaster brake, to
say nothing of unlimited spending money and permission—cruel,
unjust world!—to skip school and go swimming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
whenever he liked! True, there were things Dan
Birge did not have—he had no mother, no one to take
care of him when he was sick, no home—but boys did
not analyze these things. They only knew that Dan
Birge and his father lived at the Hotel Button like real
travelling-men, and young Dan wore better clothes and
swore more profusely and had his own way more than any
one else in the Corners. His father, rough, shaggy-haired,
black-eyed pirate that he was, feared by all,
treated this only child as something to be revered and
indulged to the point of absurdity. He was the only
human being Dan Birge had ever loved, for he had not
loved the frail little woman who had taken his name—and
his tempers—borne his son and died with a faint
sigh of relief.</p>

<p>Some claimed there was Indian blood in Dan Birge.
The ancestor discovering the lake had been a trapper and
hunter, and many said this ancestor’s wife was no less
than a Mohawk squaw. Certain it was that Dan’s graceful
self, with dark eyes and olive skin and the mop of
blue-black hair which would not “stay put,” could have
been called proof of the rumor, also his loyal, generous
actions towards the few he liked, and the cold-blooded
revenge he executed towards an enemy. As for the Birge
temper, surely it suggested tomahawks, scalping and
being burnt at the stake, with its relentless whirlwind of
expression once roused. Dan Birge’s father had the
sense to know he was a madman when he was in a rage
and he would lock himself in a room, because he was not
responsible for his actions, and wait until the spasm had
been expended.</p>

<p>His son Dan, having had little to rouse his temper, had
not yet been forced to such a procedure. Something in
the boy’s dignified manner, a deviation from his father’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
blustering self, would indicate that young Dan’s temper
could remain at white heat, influencing his actions almost
to madness long after his father’s more dramatic rage
had died away and humiliating remorse set in.</p>

<p>There was, as well, a superstition about the fate of a
woman who would marry a Birge, for all the Birges’
wives, excepting the rumored squaw, had been adoring,
meek individuals who lived until they bore a son and then
died, leaving some one else to bring him up!</p>

<p>Dan had been raised by Submit Curler, Oyster Jim,
Ali Baba, Betsey Pilrig, Hopeful Whittier—and himself.
He began domineering over his father, as a new
tyrant always wins easily over an old one, before he was
a year old. At three the Corners looked aghast at his
antics, and shivered at his vocabulary.</p>

<p>“Well,” Thurley Precore answered with spirit equal
to Dan’s, “you think you’re smart, because your pa has
money, but there’s lots of people smarter than your pa,
and I think, if a man has to choose between knowing how
to spell and everything and having a little money, he better
choose learning. Because he’ll be smart enough to
think up a way to take money from the man that don’t
know anything. Wait and see. You better go to school
while you got the chance and learn—you’ll need it some
day. My goodness, I wisht we’d ever stop in one place
long enough to let me go to school. I have to just grab
for all I know. The longest we stay anywheres is winters—out
in Iowa—and an old hoss thief, Aggie Tim,
traveled with us for awhile and he taught me my tables
and lightnin’ calculating. I bet you don’t know any—I
bet I know more’n you do—”</p>

<p>“I bet you don’t,” Dan retorted.</p>

<p>“Name the presidents of the United States,” pointing
an accusing finger at him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>“McKinley—but he’s shot and we got Roosevelt,”
Daniel bragged.</p>

<p>“I mean from the start of this country—Washington—”</p>

<p>“Oh, sure, everybody knows about him, he never told
a lie—like fun he didn’t—we don’t have school on his
birthday. But I never have to go to school, if I don’t
want to. I can stay in bed until nine o’clock and have
pork sausage and griddle cakes and coffee sent up to my
room. I can make Mrs. Hawkins send ’em up, even if
she puts it on the bill—my father lets me and he gives
me a dollar at a time and lets me spend it as I like.
Sometimes he gives me beer to drink, and he takes me to
cities on convention trips—he belongs to lodges and he
gets himself made delegate—you ought to see the hotels
we stay at with music playing for all the meals. I get a
new suit and a whole lot of stuff to play with and so much
candy that I have to stay in bed and just holler with the
stomach-ache—there!” He paused with a characteristic
Birge tilt of the head.</p>

<p>Thurley’s eyes were serious as she answered, “I’m
sorry for you. When you’re a man and have a little boy,
I hope you’ll bring him up better than you have been
brought up. You’ll go to jail, if you keep on acting so
wicked.”</p>

<p>“Jail? Why, my pa knows the sheriff an’ everybody.
I guess he knows the president.”</p>

<p>“If he knows so many people and is so smart, why
don’t he live some place besides this funny town?” Thurley
demanded.</p>

<p>This stumped Dan for a moment, then he answered,
“His property is here and he can do what he’s a mind
to. If he moved to a city, he’d have to get acquainted
with all the police and everything—see?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>“I don’t like that. I guess you better not introduce
me to your father; I wouldn’t approve of him. I won’t
live in a little town. I want to be famous and have every
one know me, when I drive through the streets, and
have people throw flowers at me, when I sing. I want to
do something wonderful—and good!” she ended emphatically.</p>

<p>“What could you do?” sneered Dan.</p>

<p>Stung by the inference, she took hold of his shoulders
and gave him a sound shaking. “I told you—sing—sing—sing,
you silly boy that can’t spell and eats too
much candy. I can sing, and nobody can take that away
from me or make me stop.”</p>

<p>She released him unexpectedly, and he fell backwards
over the step. He picked himself up in amazement, collecting
his thoughts and saying slowly, “If you were a
boy, I’d lick you.”</p>

<p>“Dare you—go on—pretend I am a boy.” She
thrust her bare foot across the imaginary, forbidden line
drawn by opponents.</p>

<p>Dan laughed. “Honest, I like you too much. You
ain’t a coward like Lorraine McDowell; she cries if a
little bit of a toad hops her way. She likes me more’n I
like her and I hate that.”</p>

<p>“Was that Lorraine with the pretty dress?” Thurley’s
red lips twitched impatiently.</p>

<p>“Oh, she’s got lots of dresses—she’s always having
parties and speaking in school, but she’s a cry-baby. Just
because she’s the minister’s daughter she thinks she’s got
to be in everything.... Thurley, what words was
spelled wrong in that circus poster?” Dan’s dark eyes
looked humbly at the new tyrant. “I’m taller’n you,” he
could not refrain from adding.</p>

<p>“People—p-e-o-p-l-e—and two ss’s in missing.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’ll change ’em, if you’ll come.”</p>

<p>“If I can find the pins.”</p>

<p>“No, you come and sing, and I’ll write on here, ‘Hear
the wonderful singer from way out west; she has travelled
miles to get here.’ It’ll be the next best thing to the
swinging man.”</p>

<p>“All right.” Thurley clapped her hands. “Who is
the swinging man?”</p>

<p>“Why, me,” he answered, in innocent surprise at her
question.</p>

<p>“Is Lorraine going to be in it?”</p>

<p>“Not much! She’s got to get pins and come and
watch us.”</p>

<p>“Then I’ll sing, because I don’t think I like ministers’
children.”</p>

<p>This was another bond between them. But Dan’s way
of showing it was to ask, “Where do you go to winters?”</p>

<p>“Mostly the winter quarters of O’Brien’s circus. Ma
used to pose in living pictures with one of the O’Brien
girls and that’s why we got invited. The quarters are
out in Iowa, and it’s just like having a real house and
home. Sometimes acrobats that got hurt during the season
rest up, or clowns, and one winter we had the india-rubber
man and his wife, the bearded woman; and he
taught me a lot of songs and she showed me two fancy
steps in dancing. Of course, the nicest part is having the
animals.”</p>

<p>“Animals?” demanded Dan incredulously. “You
mean—circus animals?”</p>

<p>“Sure, that’s what the quarters are for—tigers and
bears and monkeys and an elephant or two and a lion,
and, for the last two winters, I was big enough to help
rub in the tonic.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>Dan’s eyes were aflame with curiosity. “Tonic?” he
whispered. “What are you trying to hand me?” New
worlds were rapidly opening for the young czar.</p>

<p>“Skin tonic—to get their coats in shape for the opening
on Decoration Day. Sometimes they’re as glossy as
silk by spring. Pa and Ma used to do it when I was too
little, but their coughs got awful bad, so I took the job.”</p>

<p>“You mean—you swear to goodness,” Dan’s voice
sunk to an excited whisper, “you rubbed tonic on—on a
tiger?”</p>

<p>Thurley nodded carelessly; she saw no cause for agitation.
“Yes, they need a lot—almost as much as the
giraffe—his neck’s so long. After we used pails of it on
the giraffe, he died—wasn’t that tough beans? The
men holds ’em and we keep pouring it on and rubbing it
on—they get real used to it after awhile—most of ’em
haven’t any teeth anyhow. I wouldn’t be scared of any
circus animal, if I had a pail of our tonic with me—they
all know it for an old friend. It comes in a big, red pail
labelled ‘Ma Thorpe’s Sheep Dip—Cures Man and
Beast Alike.’ Why, one clown was the baldest thing you
ever saw and he nearly beat the Sutherland Sisters at their
own game when spring came, and the bearded lady never
sat down for a moment that she wasn’t dipping her hand
in a little saucer of it and rubbing it on her chin.”</p>

<p>“I declare,” sighed Dan, fairly writhing with envy.
“What else do you do?”</p>

<p>“Paint the props over, and the clown practises his
shines, and Ma and the bearded lady went over all the
property tights and costumes and darned and washed ’em
and sewed on new spangles. It was like a real family.
You know,” she edged up confidentially, “I always played
that it <em>was</em> a family—with the india-rubber man and his
wife for the father and mother, and the clowns and acrobats<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
for uncles and aunts, and all the animals—except
the snakes—were my brothers and sisters. I played the
snakes were out-of-town relations.”</p>

<p>“And what were your own father and mother?” Dan
managed to inquire.</p>

<p>“Merely neighbors,” Thurley said with chilly politeness.</p>

<p>Presently Dan sighed, “I wisht you’d stay in this town.
Don’t your father or mother ever work or anything?”</p>

<p>“They’re sick. I guess I ought to have been their
father and mother. All the way here I sung for food
and sold tins. Ma didn’t tell but two fortunes all the
time. She got a summer squash for one and some lake
trout for the other.”</p>

<p>“Then you’re dead poor,” the boy was thinking out
loud.</p>

<p>“Yes, but when I’m big and can sing in a hall and get
a dollar a night—then we won’t be poor. We can
travel in steam cars and Pa can have all the painkiller he
likes, and Ma can just lay on a sofa and read novels and
cry.”</p>

<p>Dan put his hand in his pocket and drew out some
money. “Thurley, I want to honest buy some pans—can
I—how much?”</p>

<p>“You’re giving me money for something you don’t
want!”</p>

<p>“By George, listen to her!” he informed the tired
horses nibbling at posts. “I do, too—I want to put
’em away for Mrs. Hawkins’ Christmas present.”</p>

<p>“She said she didn’t need any. Didn’t you hear?”</p>

<p>“But presents ain’t what you need, but what you get.”</p>

<p>“I couldn’t—you’re just being nice.”</p>

<p>“Well, I tell you—I’m manager of the show and I
can pay you to sing, can’t I?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>Thurley’s eyes brightened. Dreams do come true, if
one is patient.</p>

<p>“Yes, I’d take money for singing,” she admitted.</p>

<p>“How much?”</p>

<p>“A cent a song to begin with—if I take well, you can
make it two.”</p>

<p>Dan emptied the money into her ragged lap. “It’s
about a dollar—and you can sing a hundred songs.”</p>

<p>“At one performance?”</p>

<p>“No, we’re going to South Wales and Pike and give
our show.”</p>

<p>“Thurley, come in quick, your ma’s took bad,” called
a weak voice from within. “I guess she’ll have to be
rubbed.”</p>

<p>“I’ll have to go—thanks, Dan.”</p>

<p>“Good-by, Thurley; I hope she’s not awful sick—to-morrow—”</p>

<p>“To-morrow,” she waved one hand, the other holding
the tattered dress skirt with its burden of coins.</p>

<p>Half an hour later Mrs. Hawkins, coming to the box
wagon to find out why the travellers had not appeared for
their supper, found Thurley and her father kneeling beside
the lounge.</p>

<p>“She must have died just as I come in,” Mrs. Hawkins
told the neighbors. “Poor little lamb, blessed if
she didn’t start right in to comfort that miserable dad of
hers! Well, I guess them hosses will stay unhitched for
some time to come!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>

<p>The sale of the nags brought enough to pay for the
burial of Mrs. Precore. After which Betsey Pilrig sent
word to have some one wheel the wagon up to the empty
pasture land, across from her house, where it could stay
as long as was necessary, at least until they had enough
money to buy more horses and go somewhere else.</p>

<p>So the dingy white wagon was anchored across from
Betsey Pilrig’s, to Philena’s delight, and, while Thurley’s
father stayed inside to sob in half-drunken fashion about
“his loss,” Thurley made rapid inroads on Betsey’s and
Philena’s hearts.</p>

<p>For that matter, she had made inroads upon the hearts
of Birge’s Corners <i lang="fr">en masse</i>. Even Lorraine loaned her
a black hat for the funeral and stripped her garden of late
blossoms to lay in the wasted fingers.</p>

<p>Thurley had sung at her mother’s funeral. “They
always have music,” she told them, and, besides, “it made
her feel better inside.” So, standing at the newly dug
grave, the curious mourners watched this long-legged,
blue-eyed child-woman in every one’s discarded black
clothes sing bravely:</p>

<p>“It’s a wonder she knows any hymn tunes,” Submit
Curler had whispered to Ali Baba.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>“Says she learned ’em from a gypsy evangelist,” Ali
Baba answered, happy to be able to inform Submit Curler,
rather than be informed.</p>

<p>“She hasn’t a shoe for the winter,” Betsey Pilrig was
telling Hopeful. “Don’t it seem sinful to think of Abby
Clergy with her thousands?”</p>

<p>Hopeful nodded. “But I wouldn’t dare to mention
it. I’ve got some things of my own, Betsey. Come
around after dark. Ain’t it a disgrace to have that
man come drunk to his wife’s funeral? If God is just,
Betsey, tell me why He gave that beautiful young ’un with
an angel’s voice those parents?”</p>

<p>But the minister began to pray, so Betsey was spared
answering.</p>

<p>After the funeral, Thurley and her father had retired
within the box-car wagon to “grieve proper,” Ali Baba
summarized, and every one left them alone, except Dan
Birge, junior, who promptly knocked at the wreck of a
door.</p>

<p>Ali Baba tried to stop him, although it was nearing
four o’clock, sacred hour for Miss Clergy’s drive.</p>

<p>“Hi, you—ain’t you no reverence?” he demanded.
“There’s been death in that—that household.”</p>

<p>“I got business with her,” Dan retorted, knocking
more boldly.</p>

<p>“You don’t own this town any more’n I do. You
come down off that step, you upstart.”</p>

<p>“Chase yourself—I got to speak to Thurley.” Dan
made a tantalizing face. “You don’t dare touch me—you
ghost coachman—aha—aha—” Thurley opened
the door just in time to allow Dan to make good his
escape.</p>

<p>Within, he stood back, abashed and silent.</p>

<p>“What is it, Dan?” she asked mournfully. “If it’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
the money you gave me—it’s gone. I’m sorry, but Pa
needed ‘comfort’ for the burial.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s nothing—he got the ‘comfort’ at my
pa’s store, so it’s back in the till. I wanted to say I was
sorry and we won’t have the circus until you’re feeling
fit.”</p>

<p>Thurley’s eyes filled with tears. “Your mother’s
dead, too, ain’t she?” she asked.</p>

<p>“My mother died when I was born,” he confided. “I
guess I’d rather have it that way. It would hurt worse
to lose your mother, after you really knew her. Say,
Thurley, I wanted to tell you I’d like to have you join
our gang. There’s about eight of us now—all boys—but
I think you’d be just as good. Maybe it would make
you forget; maybe your father will go to work and you’ll
never go away from here; maybe my father will give him
a job, if he can tote barrels. I’ll ask him and you join
our gang and we’ll be happy.”</p>

<p>“I’ll have to work,” Thurley corrected. “Pa’s awful
sick; Ma thought he would die when we was on the
road. He can’t tote barrels and neither can I, but I’d
like to join the gang, Dan, if I have time. And when
your circus plays at South Wales, I’ll come and sing.”
She held out her hand in gratitude.</p>

<p>The boy took it awkwardly. “I liked you right off,”
he admitted. “If you see me getting too fresh or mis-spelling
words or things like that—tell me. I’ll take it
from you. Everybody thinks because my father made
money selling beer that I’m going to be hung. Maybe
I’ll go to school like you said—I’m not going to be any
old bum, anyhow—and, if you decide to join the gang,
we meet at Wood’s Hollow by Dog Creek every afternoon
it ain’t raining, but don’t tell Lorraine McDowell,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
because she wanted to be my girl this winter and I won’t
let her.”</p>

<p>With which he strutted out of the wagon with the serious
feeling of a muchly married man. Somehow Dan
had “adopted” Thurley. He felt personally responsible
for her happiness and support, and, when he tried convincing
his father that Thurley ought to get nine dollars
a week for doing nothing and his father jokingly dismissed
the matter, Daniel registered a vow that he must
see to it that she had everything for which her feminine
soul should desire! It was the first time in his life
that the finer part of the lad had had a chance to show
itself.</p>

<p>Philena Pilrig told her grandmother after Thurley’s
first visit, “She makes my fingers tingle down at the ends,
and, when she smiles, I want to hug her, and, when she
sings, I want to cry and dance all at once.”</p>

<p>Philena, who was eleven but small because of the
twisted spine, sat in the window facing the old wagon
car, so she could catch glimpses of Thurley striding about
bare-legged, her ragged dress fluttering gracefully in the
breeze, whistling or singing or calling out to her father
who lay on the lounge and coughed and complained.</p>

<p>Having invited the Precores to camp on her land, Betsey
Pilrig also felt responsible for their welfare. She
saw to it that Thurley washed dishes and ran errands in
return for food, and, once, when she ventured over to
interview her father as to his intentions of ever working,
Thurley stood guard on the steps to tell her “Pa was
sleeping—he’s getting that gray look around his lips.”</p>

<p>“Thurley, did you ever go to Sunday school?” she
asked one afternoon when Thurley and Philena were intent
on paper dolls.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, but it’s where you learn about the Lord and you
have a Christmas tree—the evangelist told me.”</p>

<p>“Philena gets there except in bad weather—maybe
you and she could go together,” Betsey suggested.</p>

<p>“I’ve the loveliest teacher!” Philena supplemented.
“Her name is Kate Sills, and she’s going to marry the
postmaster—she has a beautiful white plume on her
hat.”</p>

<p>“I’d like to go, if I had shoes. I guess you can’t get
in barefoot.”</p>

<p>“Maybe we can find shoes, if that’s all that’s wrong.”</p>

<p>“I can be a home missionary, granny,” Philena’s little
old face lighted with smiles. “You know—the money
in my bank.”</p>

<p>Thurley flushed. “I don’t want any one’s money—least
of all Philena’s. What is a home missionary?”</p>

<p>“I’m going to be a foreign missionary when I’m big
and strong,” Philena answered. “It’s some one who
sails off to China or Africa where they find heathens
ready to eat them up; the heathens throw their babies
into the river and don’t believe in God, and the missionaries
teach them to build nice houses and dress their
babies in white and sing songs. I heard a real true one
tell about it last winter—she stayed two days at Lorraine’s
house—and that’s what I’m going to be, isn’t it,
granny?”</p>

<p>“If you’re well enough.”</p>

<p>“Why couldn’t I go with you to Africa or China and
sing the songs, and you could pray and teach and I’d mind
the babies while you stitched up the white dresses?”
Thurley rattled on. “Let’s be missionaries together—listen,
I’ll sing some songs.”</p>

<p>“Granny, fetch all the dolls—they can be heathen—that’s
the ship we’re going on—and there is Africa all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
full of savages—get my Bible, Thurley, and my bag—we’ll
pretend we’re there now.” Philena’s crutch tapped
quickly over the floor.</p>

<p>Betsey Pilrig, supposed to be busy with her mending,
paused to listen to Philena pray for the heathen, her
crutch laid aside, kneeling on the floor of “awful Africa,”
alias the south room alcove. The heathen, six subdued,
disinterested dolls and a fast unravelling Teddy-bear,
stood in a row listening to her sweet, thin voice conclude:</p>

<p>“Oh, Lord, you have sent us here to save these people,
and, if they don’t understand what I mean and how
wrong it is to sacrifice their young and eat us up—Thurley,
isn’t it awful to have to say that to the Lord?—but
it’s so—may their hearts be inspired by the sweet,
<em>sweet</em> voiced singer who has come with me into the wilderness,
forsaking wealth and love to serve the cause.
Amen. Now, ladies of Africa,” finished Philena, opening
her eyes, “Miss Precore will sing.” She picked up
her crutch and gave way to Thurley.</p>

<p>Whereat Thurley, balancing Philena’s pink parasol
with one hand and a pretended hymnal in the other, sang
“Throw Out the Life Line” and “Onward, Christian
Soldiers,” until Betsey Pilrig, unable to remain incognito
any longer, came to the doorway to say,</p>

<p>“Thurley, Thurley, how did you ever learn to sing?”</p>

<p>Annoyed that the game be interrupted Thurley answered
shortly, “God taught me, I guess, but He made
my long legs, too. And now, Mrs. Pilrig, unless we finish,
we may be taken prisoner any minute and roasted to
ashes—look out, Philena, that big one is after you,”
brandishing her parasol to ward him off.</p>

<p>Properly rebuked Mrs. Pilrig stole away to prepare the
missionaries’ supper, while Thurley and Philena drew up
a compact, signing and dating it to read as follows:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Thurley Precore and Philena Pilrig of Birge’s Corners
do swear they will go as missionaries to convert the
heathen from eating flesh and all the other bad things
they do. Thurley will sing the songs and mind the babies
so the mothers can attend the meetings and Philena is
to preach and pray and make white dresses for every
one. If Lorraine McDowell wants to she can travel
in America and raise funds for the cause but nobody
shall ever be the same <em>dear</em> friends as Thurley Precore
and Philena Pilrig. Amen.</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Thurley Precore</span> and <span class="smcap">Philena Pilrig</span>.”</p>

</div>

<p>They put it between the pages of the illustrated Bible
and then, descending to things of the earth earthy, fell
upon a batch of newly-baked cookies with the ferocity
of the unconverted savages.</p>

<p>In the midst of her cookie Philena paused to remark,
“Thurley, do you think my being lame will make any
difference—you’re so straight and strong—”</p>

<p>Thurley finished her cookie, while she thought up her
defense. Spying tears in Philena’s eyes she went over to
fling her arms about the crooked back and declare, “Philena
Pilrig, you’ll be armed with your crutch—like a
soldier with a gun. You’ll really be better to go as a
missionary than folks that haven’t crutches,” clapping
her hands in delight at the rainbow smile.</p>

<p>“But nobody ever thinks much of cripples—Oyster
Jim fought in the Civil War, and, when he came back
lame, nobody married him and he started in having a
store—they say he wanted to be a lawyer.”</p>

<p>“Then he should have been a lawyer just the same.
Wait, Philena, I guess God wants to say something—ssh!”
Her eyes were like stars, and she warded off
Philena’s outstretched arm as if afraid mortal touch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
might dim the celestial message. “Oh, lots of times,”
she added a moment later, “God does tell me things—queer
things. Sometimes they rhyme like poems in books
and sometimes they’re cross—’cause some one has to
scold little girls and Pa and Ma never said anything to
me—so God had to scold me, and now He’s telling
me something to comfort you, Philena. What do you
think it is?”</p>

<p>“Oh, you scare me most—talking like a book—God
never tells folks things, except what He wrote down
in the Bible—whisper it, Thurley—”</p>

<p>“He says, ‘Tell Philena that cripples can be conquerors,’”
sang Thurley in a clear monotone, “cripples can
be conquerors—there—I guess you’ll be as good a missionary
as ever lived.”</p>

<p>Philena repeated it in an awed tone. “That’s beautiful—now
I don’t care about my crutch ... but how
can you tell for sure it’s God talking?”</p>

<p>Thurley’s eyes were like sapphires in the sun. “Something
taps at my heart and I know I’m going to have a
wonderful something told me—or a terrible scolding—and
then whatever it is God wants to say is just <em>sung</em>
into my head and I know—I do know, Philena, I am
right.”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t tell any one, if I was you,” Philena suggested
enviously.</p>

<p>“No, there’s as much about children that grownups
don’t understand, as there is about grownups we don’t
understand,” Thurley said sagely. “But you can always
remember that God said that straight to me—‘cripples
can be conquerors’—just like He told me at
Midland City, Illinois, ‘You let me catch you cutting
off your hair and trying to run away and I’ll stop your
singing mighty quick!’ See, Philena?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>“Isn’t it funny?” Thurley told her father that night,
“I’m to belong to the gang and play robbers and Indians,
and I’m to be a missionary with Philena, and there must
be different halves of me, and Dan has seen one half
and thinks it is a whole, and so has Philena. I wonder
what I’d do if the gang met the same day I’d promised
to play missionary?”</p>

<p>A cough answered her. “Is there any more rum?”
he fretted.</p>

<p>Regretfully Thurley produced the bottle. “Don’t
drink until you see things,” she begged. “Makes me
shiver when you talk down low—there—that’s enough
for now.... I guess if the gang met on missionary
day, I’d make ’em all sit down in front of me and I’d
sing to ’em—something awful different from gang stuff
or missionary hymns, and then neither could be cross.”</p>

<p>“I guess,” her father hiccoughed, “you’ll—hic—always
be a good fellow.”</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<p>It was not until Thurley allied herself with the gang
at Wood’s Hollow that she came into possession of the
Corners’ great mystery—Abigail Clergy who lived in
solitary grandeur in the red brick mansion overlooking
the lake.</p>

<p>After Thurley had proved herself as great a success as
a good fellow to the gang as she had at convincing Philena
of her possibilities as a missionary, and had played hi-spy
half the afternoon, she wandered by chance towards the
first of the deserted summer houses in lieu of a new hiding
place and became fascinated by these silent buildings.
She began exploring one after the other, forgetful of the
faint “Hul-l-o-o—Thur-lee” which the gang sent in
her direction.</p>

<p>Boarded-up windows did not yield to her strong fingers
nor tottering verandas offer a cordial invitation to
rest. There was a chill in the October air, and Thurley
gladly scampered up and down one pair of steps after another,
peering into one dark room and then another,
wandering through weed-choked gardens and pausing under
apple trees to make up stories to suit each house.
In her imaginative way she peopled the places with
golden-haired ladies and blue-eyed babies, handsome gentlemen
driving smart horses, and then every one sitting
down to eat tons of good things served by colored waiters.
In her motley travels through the country Thurley
had obtained glimpses of such elegance, if not actually
experiencing it.</p>

<p>The gang was forgotten, so was Philena, and the fact<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
that she had promised to play missionary at five o’clock.
She forgot, as well, that her father was out of “comfort,”
and would complain all night unless he was supplied,
and that she had been worrying all morning as to
what they should do when snow carpeted the meadow and
the box-car wagon proved inefficient against wind and
frost!</p>

<p>Thurley was living in an enchanted land all her own—these
houses were hers! One by one she made the imaginary
tenants leave and go elsewhere, while she became
an imprisoned princess doomed to spend a year in
each house before she could be free of the ten-headed
dragon! She ran along the shore in delight as she contemplated
her prisons. Each day she would come and
camp on the outside of the house in which she was imprisoned,
playing princess in spangled crimson and lace
and pretending the ten-headed dragon lived in a cave in
the bottom of the lake and could poke one of his heads
up at unexpected moments to see if his prisoner was behaving
as he desired!</p>

<p>Then she spied a light burning in the last of the houses.
She wondered if she had imagined “until it was better
than real,” a favorite experience. But as she came
closer, she saw several lights and unmistakable signs of
long-accustomed habitation.</p>

<p>“This was the loveliest house of all,” she thought
mournfully, “and it had to be lived in!”</p>

<p>Yet this house betrayed signs of decay; the shutters on
one side were fastened tightly and bricks dislodged from
an unused chimney. Thurley could not refrain from taking
an extra peek. She made her way to the side and
crept up the steps gently to push at the carved old door
with its tarnished knocker.</p>

<p>It opened! Taut with excitement and fearless, Thurley<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
felt that she ought to repeat a charm to save herself
from being changed into a mouse or a rubber plant or
some such helpless creation.</p>

<p>Inside the house burned a jewelled lamp; bulky objects
were shrouded with covers. The boards creaked under
her sturdy feet as she tiptoed about. A musty smell pervaded
everything, and there were several doors, one of
which she was about to open when a voice from the stairway
made her halt.</p>

<p>“Ali Baba, it isn’t four o’clock. How dare you come
inside?” said the voice. Looking up, Thurley saw a
bent-over lady in an old black dress, her yellowed fingers
shining with rings as they clutched the banister.
Her thin, pointed face with its restless eyes was looking
over towards the opened door; she had not spied Thurley.</p>

<p>“Close that door, you stupid Ali Baba; never dare to
come here again—where are you? Why”—this with
a hysterical scream—“it’s a child—a <em>child</em>—” and the
little old lady began running down the stairs, beating her
hands in the air, as if trying to strike at Thurley.</p>

<p>Thurley turned, throwing back her head in defiance and
calling out, “Lock your doors, if you don’t want company,”
making a hasty retreat at the same time.</p>

<p>Racing down the path, Thurley came into collision with
Ali Baba, who was on his way to hitch Melba to the
coupé.</p>

<p>“For cat’s sake, where do you come from?” he demanded,
holding Thurley by her arm.</p>

<p>Thurley, making sure the door of the house had closed
and the little old lady vanished, whispered, “I thought
I’d have a look, so I went inside and some one came down
the stairs and said, ‘Ali Baba, it isn’t four o’clock!’—and
when she saw me, she was cross.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>Ali Baba dropped her arm. “Have you been <em>inside</em>
that house?”</p>

<p>Thurley nodded. “Just in the hallway—she found
me there.”</p>

<p>“Land sakes and Mrs. Davis,” Ali Baba said, smiling
in spite of himself. “I guess you’ve done what no other
kid in the Corners has ever dared to try. But don’t do it
again—children should not be seen nor heard, according
to Miss Abby,” and he brushed by her on his way to the
barn.</p>

<p>Thurley was not satisfied with this answer. She went
back to the Corners to find Philena’s pale face pressed
against the window glass watching for her missionary
partner’s tardy appearance.</p>

<p>“Philena, I have been in a funny brick house at the
lake,” Thurley said, “and I want your granny to tell me
why it is so queer—and who that old woman is, and who
is Ali Baba and why can’t any one ever go there?”</p>

<p>Betsey Pilrig, who was passing through the room,
stopped in amazement. “Have you been inside the
Clergy house?” she demanded.</p>

<p>Thurley told her experience.</p>

<p>Betsey sought refuge in the nearest rocking-chair.
“Then, listen, Thurley, for as long as you’ve come to
stay a spell, you ought to know—and I guess I can tell
you as well as Hopeful Whittier or Ali Baba. A long
time ago, most thirty-five years, that house was lived in by
Mr. and Mrs. Lemuel Clergy, of New York City, and
they were worth more money than they could count, but
all they cared for was Abigail, their daughter, and they
were going to leave her everything they owned just because
they loved her so much. But they always planned
she would marry some one and be as happy as a queen.”</p>

<p>Betsey paused for a properly doleful sigh. “As I was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
sayin’, my cousin, Hopeful Whittier, had married, and
her husband, Jim Whittier, was drowned on the Great
Lakes three months after their weddin’ day. Hopeful
came back to Birge’s Corners, just like to die of grief.
Mrs. Clergy heard of it and came to see her, and she says,
‘My dear, come and live with us—Abby needs a maid
of her own these days, and I think she’d like you.’ Of
course poor Hopeful didn’t know about bein’ a lady’s
maid and fixin’ hair and lace and all that Miss Abby
wanted done. But she was so heartbroken for Jim—they
never found his body—that she was glad to go, and
the Clergys were so good to her and Miss Abby so kind
and willin’ to show her how she wanted everything fixed
that Hopeful was as happy as she could be—without
forgettin’ Jim.</p>

<p>“In them days the Clergy house—The Fincherie is
its name—was never without guests. My stars, I’ve
known as many as thirty extra people packed in there
for a week at a time, and every other house on the
shore the same with balls and basket picnics, charades
and corn bakes and sailin’ trips every minute in the day!
But out of every one there—and there was the grandest
and the finest in the land—there was no one half so
beautiful nor gay nor kindhearted as Abby Clergy—no
one could deny but what it was so. Her father’s money
and her fine clothes and jewels and her beauty didn’t turn
her head a mite.</p>

<p>“Let me see—I guess she was around seventeen when
Hopeful first went there—girls was more advanced at
seventeen than they are now. That fall, when it came
time to close the house and go to New York, Abby Clergy
tells Hopeful she wants her to come and live in their New
York house the same as if she was one of these high-flyer
maids they bring from Paris. Of course Hopeful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
was mighty glad, for she had come to love Miss Abby
and she knew Jim would have told her to go, if he
could have done it. But before they closed the house,
they give a harvest dance, so they called it—late in September
it was—and I never did see such a time. The
stables were packed with teams, and the steam cars ran a
special train to South Wales for some of the people, and a
fellow in New York sent the food, and champagne just
flowed like the lake water. They had fiddlers from New
York, and a florist with a load of flowers to fix up every
room, and nobody else on the lake shore thought of going
home until the Clergys’ harvest dance was over.</p>

<p>“Hopeful used to tell me everything that was goin’ on
and she often says, ‘Betsey, that girl is too beautiful and
good to live—I’m afraid she is goin’ to be taken.’ I
laffed at her and said she’d marry a fine gentleman, and
Hopeful would watch their children playin’ on the beach,
but Hopeful always said no, she had a feeling things
wouldn’t be right. Now Abby Clergy was beautiful—just
five feet tall, she was, and slight as a reed. She had
big, black, satiny eyes and an ivory skin. It was natural
for her never to have color and her hair was blue black,
combed up high and fastened with a carved comb, and,
when she laffed, Ali Baba said her teeth was prettier than
her strings of pearls—real pearls they was, too—but
I must tell you something about Ali Baba.</p>

<p>“Nobody never thought of calling Joshua Maples anything
but Josh, until Miss Abby named him Ali Baba
after he started bein’ her father’s summer coachman and
winter caretaker. One day he says to her, ‘Miss Abby,
don’t you ever worry about anybody’s stealin’ this house.
Just dismiss it from your mind the minute you leave here
in the fall—and I ain’t goin’ to let any one steal you,
neither.’ And she laffs and says, ‘Why, who wants to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
steal me?’ And that was a joke, because Abby Clergy
had more beaux than she could remember their names,
but she just smiled at them all and never cared any more
for any particular one than she did for any particular rose
that was bloomin’ outside her window. ‘A lot of
thieves,’ says Josh—he was pretty smart in talking—‘and
I guess you’ll have to ask me as well as your Pa
before I give my consent.’ That sort of tickled her and
she jumped up and down and says, ‘You be Ali Baba, and
I’ll let you watch over the forty thieves,’ and from then
on he was Ali Baba to her, and nobody else ever called
him any other name.</p>

<p>“So the harvest party was a grand success. But
there come down from New York a stranger, Count Sebastian
Gomez, who was introduced to Mr. and Mrs.
Clergy as an Eyetalian nobleman with a lot of castles
and such truck over in Europe and more money than he
wanted. He was a fine-lookin’ fellow, tall and straight
as an arrow, and he had a curled-up mustache and big,
bold eyes that looked you clean through. He was
dressed way up in G, and could talk a lot of these here
foreign languages, and he wanted to kiss all the ladies’
hands and everybody thought he was the finest sort of
fellow they could ever wish to see....</p>

<p>“But Hopeful Whittier didn’t like him, and she says,
when she saw how he was makin’ up to Miss Abby, flatterin’
her and kissin’ her hand and writin’ his name down
for all the dances and starin’ angry-like at any other fellow
who tried to look at her—she thought then that
Miss Abby was makin’ a mistake. But if this count
hadn’t eyes for any one but Miss Abby, Miss Abby didn’t
have eyes for any one but the count. And Hopeful
told me that, when she undressed Miss Abby that night,
Miss Abby says to her, ‘Hopeful, I am a happy girl—I’m<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
so happy I don’t know how to understand it—I’ve
seen some one I could love better than my own dear father
and mother.’ Hopeful tried to warn her, she didn’t
know why, but Miss Abby wouldn’t listen, and she sat up
half the night, Hopeful says, thinkin’ about him.</p>

<p>“The next day the guests went drivin’, and the count
managed to set beside Miss Abby when they rode and at
the basket picnic and never to let her out of his sight.
Abby’s Pa and Ma seemed pleased about it, and they told
their friends Count Gomez was of royal blood and he had
letters provin’ he was all he said he was. Well, that
didn’t win over Hopeful Whittier nor Ali Baba, but they
didn’t matter, of course. So Hopeful went back to New
York with the family, and Ali Baba closed up the place.
In the middle of the winter I got a letter from Hopeful
sayin’ that the count and Miss Abby were engaged, and
all New York was talkin’ about the foreign alliance, and
how grand it was to marry a nobleman and be a real
Eyetalian countess. She said Miss Abby was so happy
she just floated about and that she was having trunks and
trunks of dresses made because he was goin’ to take her to
his palace over in Italy and she wanted his family to
think well of her. I didn’t like the sound of it, neither,
but I didn’t think no more about it until in the spring, the
last of Easter week, a coach and two bay hosses just came
tearin’ into the Corners at dusk and put up at the Button
livery.</p>

<p>“Late that night Hopeful come up here lookin’ as if
she had seen a ghost. ‘Good heavens, Betsey,’ she says,
‘we’ve brought Abby Clergy home a ravin’ maniac!’
Well, I didn’t know what to answer, but she went on to
tell me that just before the weddin’ was to take place—on
Easter Monday night—and all New York was invited
to come and see an American girl become an Eyetalian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
countess, didn’t that scoundrel clear out and they find
he had a wife and five children hidin’ up in Michigan and
that he wasn’t nothin’ but a common barber! It was a
grand swindle—you know this idea of our girls marryin’
them noblemen was kind of new those days and nobody
was smart enough to ask all the questions that they would
have done if it was to happen now. It seems he had
taken a lot of Miss Abby’s jewelry and she had loaned
him money, him tellin’ her his ‘allowance’ was bein’
held up and such truck, and she, poor innocent lamb, believin’
him!</p>

<p>“They didn’t try to do nothin’ to him; the shame was
enough to bear without goin’ any further. Hopeful said
Mr. Clergy walked the floor all that night, and, finally, he
told his lawyer, ‘Let the wretch go, thank God the girl
was spared the farce of a marriage.’ So I guess the
count and his wife and five children took the Clergy money
and opened a shavin’ parlor somewheres in Michigan and
I suppose God took care of him when He got around to it.</p>

<p>“But it took Abby Clergy’s reason for the time bein’,
and it killed her Ma. When word came about him bein’
false and all, Abby was tryin’ on her weddin’ dress and
she fainted dead away. When she come to and they undressed
her, she fought ’em like a tiger and kept screamin’
out that it was not so. Finally, they got her calmed
down and the doctor came and she told him she never
wanted to see any one again; she wanted to go and live
for a whole year at the old summer home at Birge’s Lake,
where she thought she could forget her sorrow and bury
her shame. But she didn’t want to see nor speak to any
one—not even her father or mother; she just wanted
Hopeful to stay with her.</p>

<p>“I guess if she had asked for the moon they’d have
tried to have got it for her. So they packed up her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
things, and she and Hopeful came all the way to the Corners
by team, and Ali Baba hurried up and made new fires
in the house and Miss Abby was put to bed as helpless as
a newborn child.</p>

<p>“For three months she had the real old-fashioned
kind of brain fever. I guess they don’t have it any more.
Some say it has left her queerer than others; I don’t know
as to that; I only know that Hopeful never stirred from
the Fincherie from the day Miss Abby came until she was
out of danger, and then they had to tell her her ma had
died six weeks before. Miss Abby had a relapse and
never talked except when she was out of her head.
She’d moan, ‘Sebastian—Sebastian—I love you—’
And she’d think Hopeful was that Eyetalian fraud and
she’d hold out her little hands to her and beg him not to
leave her and to prove he never had no wife!</p>

<p>“When she got through with that, it was fall and she
had never set eyes on no one but Hopeful and the doctor.
She sent for her father, and in Hopeful’s presence she
said she wanted to live the rest of her life at the Fincherie
with Hopeful and Ali Baba as her servants and she
never wanted to take part in the world again, that she was
not crazy, she knew her own mind. But she had a broken
heart and she could not bear to let the world see all she
had suffered.</p>

<p>“It ’most killed her pa—her hair had turned gray
and she didn’t weigh more’n a handful—but she kept
beggin’ him, and, finally, the doctor said time might
change her, but it was no sense to argue with her now—so
her father said she could stay there, and stay she has!
It wasn’t long after that when her poor father died, but
Miss Abby never went to the funeral nor shed a tear.
Seems as if all the love and tears God gave her were spent
on that rascal. She had the lawyer sell the town property<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
and put the money in banks, and some of the furniture
they sent on to the Fincherie, but she never let Ali
Baba unpack it. And there she lived and there she lives—every
day at four she drives in that old coupé with Ali
Baba as the coachman. Outside of that, or maybe settin’
on the back balcony when it’s pretty hot weather, Miss
Abby never shows herself. Nobody dares to go there
neither. At first, the old friends tried to make her be
herself, but she wouldn’t listen or even see ’em. She’s a
sort of living death, like, wearin’ the same old clothes and
stayin’ in her two front rooms year in and year out. Of
course Hopeful has given up her life, you might say, to
Miss Abby; she could have married many’s the time, but
somehow she’s stayed faithful and so has Ali Baba. I
guess it was meant to be so. Sometimes Miss Abby tries
to thank Hopeful for all she’s done and she gives her
presents of money—but she can’t never seem to take an
interest in anything, and when it comes the anniversary
of her weddin’, Hopeful says she unlocks her trunks and
keeps tryin’ on all her weddin’ dresses and cryin’ soft and
pitiful. The family lawyer has had doctors and doctors
and mind-healers and faith-healers and all such people
but nothing never done any good. She just lives in the
house like a little old shadow, never hurtin’ no one and
doin’ nothin’ wrong—sort of hauntin’ herself, that’s the
best way to say it. She’s only fifty-five—but she seems
seventy—sort of childish and sharp spoke, if things
don’t go to suit, and she’s talkin’ of putting up a big wall
around the house so’s nobody could even walk across the
lawn.... Well, well, Thurley, so you got inside!”</p>

<p>Philena’s hands were clasped in excitement. “Isn’t it
sad, Granny?” she said. “I want to cry.”</p>

<p>Thurley shook her head. “I don’t. I’d like to write
a story about it and set it to music and rent a big hall.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
Then I’d have people pay to come in and hear me sing it
to them and I’d rather make the people cry.”</p>

<p>Betsey Pilrig shook her head. “Thurley,” she said,
lapsing into old-time phraseology, “I guess there’s no
danger of your ever comin’ in with your leg in your arm.
I guess if you see your comeupment ahead, you’ll manage
to sing your way out of it.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>

<p>So it was that in 1912 the second thrilling event happened.</p>

<p>Young Daniel Birge, proprietor of Birge’s General
Dry Goods Store, successor to Submit Curler, left his
office, a built-up perch back of the shoe counter, to meet
Thurley Precore at four o’clock.</p>

<p>The four clerks knew he was going to meet Thurley,
that he had been meeting her and would continue to do so
every pleasant afternoon, and they might as well ask any
questions they wished before this hour, because business
did not enter their handsome young proprietor’s head
again until he was forced to re-enter the store the next
morning.</p>

<p>The clerks, three of whom were under twenty and in
love with Dan and one of whom was nearing fifty and
longed to put him “dead to rights,” exchanged knowing
glances as they watched Dan stalk out of the store humming
a popular air and nodding a jaunty good night.</p>

<p>Birge’s Corners naturally had expected something of
Dan Birge—who wouldn’t of the only son of a saloon
keeper and man of money, according to the Corners’ estimate,
who had been brought up at the Hotel Button and
permitted to do as he liked? Having so far escaped the
gallows, Dan had proceeded to shock the natives as much
as was possible. He began at sixteen, when, “like a
streak of grease lightnin’,” according to Prince Hawkins,
he started in to educate himself by mail order courses,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
having skipped school and defied teachers years without
end. With the Birge determination, once started in any
direction, Dan no longer haunted the barroom or the
blacksmith’s shop; he went to Betsey Pilrig’s house, where
her adopted daughter, Thurley Precore, welcomed and
studied with him.</p>

<p>Lorraine McDowell, the minister’s daughter, would
have been only too glad to teach Dan Birge, the
gossips had it, but Dan had never known Lorraine existed
from the day Thurley had first “sung for her supper.”</p>

<p>Too proud to admit such was the case, Lorraine had
sensibly set to work to be as useful as any minister’s
daughter ought to be in a small town, and if she had her
own particular form of heartache when she saw Dan and
Thurley walking or riding together or taking supper at
the Hotel Button, she kept it well concealed and smiled
upon them and every one else alike.</p>

<p>After Dan had been “learning” for two years, while
his father bragged that his son would outrival college
professors—and all by mail, too—the older Birge died
from an apoplectic stroke, leaving Dan his heir with the
flourishing tavern, blacksmith’s shop and real estate office
to take in hand.</p>

<p>This was the only time that Dan had been known to
consult any one—and every one knew Thurley had put
him up to doing it, to say nothing of his being under
age—but he went to the minister and they had a long
talk, after which a sign “Closed” was across the saloon
doorway, and carpenters came from out of town to make
the place over into such a store as the Corners had never
dreamed of possessing.</p>

<p>“My father was an honest saloon keeper, I guess,”
Dan had told Thurley, “but that business don’t suit
me—nor you,” he added tenderly. “I’m going to keep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
a dry goods store that will curdle all the milk in the South
Wales emporium. I’m eighteen, Thurley, and when I’m
twenty-one and rid of trustees, I’ll ask you to marry me,
and, when I’m twenty-two, we’ll be married.”</p>

<p>At which Thurley, admiring his audacity, had waived
the question and began to suggest what lines of goods had
best be carried.</p>

<p>It was only natural that the older generation could not
understand a modern youth who would pay ten hard-earned
dollars for a bull puppy, and then name her Zaza
and pay two dollars more for a brass-studded collar and
be willing to settle all claims for partially chewed up
rubbers or boots for which the said Zaza seemed to have
a penchant!</p>

<p>Neither did they see the necessity of Dan’s trips to
New York to buy goods. Submit Curler had never done
it, and, if one could “learn by mail,” why not buy as well?
Nor did they see the reason for Dan’s red and white
canoe, the “Water Demon,” fitted with an awning and
striped cushions and a thirty-five dollar talking machine in
the center of it, and why, when every one ought to be at
work, Dan and Thurley would drift along the lake to the
tune of “Dearie” or “Are You Coming Out To-night,
Mary Ann?” while Zaza, unasked guest, would swim out
and try to upset the cargo. And when Dan engaged two
rooms and had a <em>private bathroom</em> installed at the Hotel
Button and built a small balcony opening out of his sitting
room, the younger generation fell down and worshipped blindly,
while the older generation said a Birge
never “built a cupola no place without wanting to get
out on it and look down on every one,” and, “there was
as much sense in all his notions as there would be in putting
a deaf mute at a telephone switchboard.”</p>

<p>When Dan was quoted as saying he did not “feel right<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
unless his suits were made by a New York tailor,” and,
without consulting any one, bought a scarlet roadster and
talked of building two-family houses as an investment, to
say nothing of the twenty thousand dollar house with an
iron deer in the front yard and steam heat that he would
build when he married Thurley Precore—the older generation
tilted their chairs back and recalled the story of
the negro about to be hung, who said upon approaching
the gallows, “Dis am gwine to be a powerful lesson to
dis nigger!”</p>

<p>Yet the town had to admit that Dan built up the Corners
more than any of his ancestors or contemporaries.
He ventured money in a moving picture show and made it
pay, mollifying the churches by turning over the proceeds
of the Passion Play for a new carpet for a Sunday-school
room and new front steps for the rival denomination.
He installed an ice cream soda fountain in Oyster
Jim’s store, lending the old man the money, and
started the vogue for modern sidewalks and a town
clock—and even a manicure! There was no telling to
what lengths he might have gone, if he had not been so
in love with Thurley that she occupied his thoughts
twenty-three and a half hours out of the twenty-four, but
he managed to do wonders with the remaining half hour.
The town often said he no doubt would have borrowed
their farm teams to make polo ponies, and it was
suspected that he was striving frantically to “get up a
board of health.”</p>

<p>Certain it was that Dan was not afraid to spend his
money—some declared it was a hundred thousand and
some a hundred and ten thousand. And, most glorious
achievement of all, he liberally pensioned Submit Curler,
whose eyes were too dim to tell basting thread from sewing
silk.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>When Dan would try to convince Ali Baba of some
needed modern enterprise, Ali Baba would retort angrily,
“Who made you so wise and your elders fools? Be
careful or you’ll catch brain fever and be as bald as a
badger!”</p>

<p>To which Dan would answer good-naturedly, “No
doubt of it—didn’t you know that grass never grows on
a busy street?”</p>

<p>Which would leave Ali Baba chuckling, “Land sakes
and Mrs. Davis, if that boy hasn’t a little Irish in him—dead
dog eat a hatchet!”</p>

<p>No one could say Dan underpaid or cheated any person
with whom he had dealings. His store had an up-to-date,
live air and one could find bargains and articles
which had never been seen in former days. Also, when
travelling men came to sell him and he entertained them
at his attempted bachelor apartments, they would suggest
a game of penny-ante and something to drink, and the boy
would inform them with no shrinking indecision, “I was
raised watching men make fools of themselves,” and bid
them good night.</p>

<p>When he married Thurley Precore, the town gossiped,
Dan would meet his match, and, in concluding their jeremiad,
said they doubted whether Thurley would marry
him after all, but if, for spite, he married Lorraine, who,
goodness knows, would jump sky high if she ever had the
chance, Dan Birge would be the same bully his father had
been to his wife—there never was a Birge who didn’t
have to boss the job or quit!</p>

<p>None of this bothered Dan, not even the vituperation
of himself when he encouraged a family of Sicilian bootmakers
to rent one of his cottages and began to <em>pay to
have his shoes shined</em>. Nothing bothered Dan except the
fear lest Thurley should not marry him; that only bothered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
him at stray moments when a wilful impulse led her
to break an engagement with him and run off to sing at
some entertainment at South Wales.</p>

<p>As he strode along the main street, Zaza heeling him,
he whistled “Bonnie Sweet Bessie” and shouted out a
hullo to every one he passed, regardless of age or rank.
There was something delightfully irrepressible about
Dan. Perhaps the fact that every girl in town was or
had been or was planning to be in love with him might
have aided his buoyancy, as well as the knowledge that
the older generation still looked at him with horrified disapproval
and yet were powerless to control so much as a
single one of Zaza’s barks.</p>

<p>He made his way up the winding path leading to the
burial ground, one of those picturesque spots with weeping
willows, wild roses and a tottering old fence, and
scraggly berry bushes growing insolently without.</p>

<p>“Oh, Thurley,” he began, calling before he reached
the summit.</p>

<p>“Ship ahoy!” sang back a strong, sweet voice. Presently
he came upon a tall, blue-eyed girl with thick braids
of dark hair. She was sitting under a willow tree, a
book thrown carelessly at one side.</p>

<p>“Thurley, dearest,” he began, sitting down and kissing
her, “I thought four o’clock would never come.”</p>

<p>“Did you make mistakes in change?” She put her
hand on his shoulder. “If the clerks could see their lord
and master now,” and she rumpled up his hair.</p>

<p>“Bother the clerks and the whole darned town—I’ve
made you promise to marry me, Thurley, and you’re not
going to make me keep it a secret. Why don’t we tell
every one right away? What’s the use of keeping it to
ourselves, when we are both sure of ourselves and the
happiest things alive?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>Thurley laughed indulgently. “It’s just me, Dan. I
want to be terribly sure of myself.”</p>

<p>He took her hands in his. “You are! You love
me. You’ve always cared for me, as I have for you—’way
back ten years ago when you joined the gang! I
have all the money we need and you may have it all. Say
we won’t keep it a secret! I’m dead tired of the Hotel
Button; it gets on my nerves these days. Mrs. Hawkins
has been mighty white to me—when I know what a
spoiled nuisance I must have been—but she’s a perfect
litany of woe. I can hear her now, ‘Wal, there wuz two
funerals down to South Wales to-day—an’ I meant to
make a lemon pie but there wuz no lemons!’ Or else she
gets on another tactic—of borrowers—and she greets
a chap with, ‘Don’t never talk about borrowers, Dan
Birge; my curtain frames has been as far as the next
township, and sometimes I ain’t set eyes on my ice cream
freezer from May to November!’ And if I’m trying
extra hard to think about business—and I’m really thinking
about you—she starts in about somebody’s second
cousin’s divorce and soliloquizes, ‘We’re all members of
one human family and God never meant for man and wife
to live together like cat and dog.’ And I’ve never known
it to fail that I was hurrying to get away to meet some
one—and it was ’most always you—that she didn’t drag
me into her sitting room to see some of her damned—excuse
me, Thurley—embroidery that she’s going stone
blind by doing and listen to her explain, ‘These two
doilies is just alike, only one is blue with flowers and the
other is pink with stars and anchors—they’re a weddin’
present for Mrs. P. L. Flanigan—her second wedding,
too; she’s been on the stage since she could lisp, supported
Madame Modjeska all through the West and then married
a no good Irish comedian.... Oh, Dan, don’t be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
in a hurry! Look at this one—ain’t it a work of art,
if I do say so—clover is like sweet peas, awful hard to
embroider natural.’”</p>

<p>Dan paused, out of breath.</p>

<p>“Yes,” Thurley said soberly, “but she has her meals
on time, and you eat them.”</p>

<p>“My Swedish appetite is always with me, no joke; but
what of that? Do you think I expect you to drudge like
Prince Hawkins’ wife? Not much. We are going to
have a <em>maid</em>, no hired girl, but a trained maid, and we’ll
pay her five and maybe six dollars a week, and a wash-woman
besides that.”</p>

<p>“The town will say I’m lazy. Lorraine McDowell
does all the work at the parsonage and visits the poor
families besides.”</p>

<p>“That’s very fine in Lorraine, but she isn’t my Thurley.
You just couldn’t pin yourself down to routine,
could you?” He looked at her admiringly. “The best
you can do is to pin the other chap down to it—like you
did me. It is you who made me study and make good;
I was a spoiled kid with more money than was good for
me and no one with a grain of faith as to my future.
They were holding their breath until I’d get into a scrape
and they could go at me without gloves. Well, I didn’t,
unless they call loving Thurley Precore and being engaged
to her a scrape! Of course they’ve patted me on
the shoulder now and said decent things, but I’m twenty-two
and a man, and they can’t do otherwise. I guess you
said about all there was to say when you told me, ‘The
best vault in which to keep your fortune is a good education.’”</p>

<p>Thurley leaned over to kiss him on the forehead.
“You’re a wonder,” she whispered, “but, really, wouldn’t
Lorraine make you happier?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>His face clouded with an injured expression. “Why
drag in Lorraine? She’d like to drag herself in,” he
admitted candidly, “and I guess every one knows it, but
you don’t fall in love to suit the other fellow—and I
don’t love Lorraine.”</p>

<p>“She’s so pretty and frail, and you’re such a big, strong
gypsy lad,” mused Thurley, pulling sprays of feathery
grass idly, “and I’m such a big, strong gypsy lass that
we’re not contrasts. We’re too much alike, Dan; too
selfish in the same way. Every one is bound to be selfish
in some way or other, but when you both hit the same
trail, it usually ends in a crash ... please, wait until I
finish. Then we’re too fond of having our own ways.
I’d like it if you became Daniel Precore instead of my
becoming Thurley Birge; yes, I truly would. I don’t
want to promise to love, honor and obey any one—not a
bit of it. I want to do what I dreamed of as a child—those
dreams kept me alive, Dan. I want to sing, not in
the town, but in New York, London, Paris. I’ve read
of girls from the country who made good, and I can sing,
Dan! It is not silly for me to say it. Besides, there is
little else I can do!”</p>

<p>“I know it,” he said in a muffled tone, “but why not
sing just for me? I’ll always listen.”</p>

<p>“That’s the trouble. I want to sing for thousands of
strangers; I want to be famous, Dan, and yet, I want you
for my pal. Don’t you see that it doesn’t go together as
it should? For me to stay here as your wife, and for
me to travel all over the world and be on the stage—and
all that would go with it. I wouldn’t be your wife unless
I was sure to be the right wife. Dear old boy, you shrug
your shoulders every time I try to explain it. But I’m
different from Lorraine and the other girls. I’m selfish
and generous all in one, quick tempered and patient by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
turns. I hate to fuss about details. Domesticity drives
me mad, poor Granny Pilrig can tell you! I’d sit up half
the night to learn a song or read a book, and then I’d
want to be hideously lazy the next morning. Sometimes
I feel as if I were floating in the air, flying with absolutely
divine ease and bliss just because of something deep inside
myself—I haven’t the faintest idea what it is. I can
sing on hilltops and laugh in the grayest of drizzles.
Everything can be in glorious purples and golden colors.
And when the sun is actually bright and every one is congratulating
every one on the weather, I find myself old,
tired, black within. I want to cry, scream, go away from
every one and neither speak nor move. That’s what they
call temperament, I understand, and you, Dan boy,”
Thurley’s lovable mouth curved into smiles, “you could
never say that is a good basis for a happy marriage—particularly
to a gentleman with a ‘Swedish appetite’ and
one who likes to be amused when he comes home tired out
from a bargain sale of kitchen oilcloth!”</p>

<p>“Well, what is the basis for a happy marriage? Mrs.
Hawkins says ‘young folks should set down and talk
about what they each like to eat before the engagement is
announced!’ I guess we can pass that up.”</p>

<p>“Did you know what Mrs. Hawkins said about me, as
being a good wife for you? It’s funny! She told
Granny and Granny told me. She said, ‘I bet Thurley
would dust the divil out of her cut glass and rustle into
her georgette crêpes to get to a singing bee; but cook that
boy a square meal, darn a sock, stand a bit of the Birge
temper—never!’”</p>

<p>“She’s just a meddlesome old woman,” Dan began
angrily.</p>

<p>“She’s truthful and she likes us both. Don’t let’s rush
ahead and be married until we are sure, and until you try<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
once more to see if you don’t love Lorraine; it seems so
cruel when she cares so hard.”</p>

<p>“If she writes me any more silly notes about maple
sugar socials on her everlasting pink paper and smelling
of shampoo powders, I’ll stop speaking to her,” he declared.
“Let’s settle it to-day, Thurley—announce our
engagement in the Saturday <cite>Gazette</cite>. Everything I have
or ever will have is yours. I love you; I’ll do what you
say and be as you would have me. Darling, you’ve no
one in this world to look out for you and I’ve no one to
look out for. Let me take care of you! Please, I care
so hard.” His dark, handsome face was very close to
hers and, suddenly, he laid his head on her shoulder,
smothering a sob.</p>

<p>Thurley’s sunrise, rose-red self went out to him in
sympathy. “Does it mean so much?”</p>

<p>“Just—everything,” was the incoherent answer.</p>

<p>“Then—I will.” Tears came into her blue eyes.
“I couldn’t make you wait any longer. Look at me.”
She lifted his face between her hands and they looked
into each other’s eyes for a long, wonderful instant.
“Dan, it may be a mistake, but I think I do love you
even if I’m not willing to be a house-and-garden wife and
stop my singing.... I’d perish if I stopped singing, so
promise me you’ll never ask it.”</p>

<p>“Not in church and parlors and like that,” he said
unwillingly, “but my wife isn’t going to sing on the
stage.”</p>

<p>Thurley’s brows drew together in perplexity. “Well,
maybe no one will ever ask me,” she evaded. “We
won’t quarrel about it until they do—only I’d fight you
pretty hard if you tried to stop my singing—it means
even more than you do!”</p>

<p>“It won’t after we are married,” he asserted jealously,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
“and I won’t wait long for you either. We’ll live at the
hotel until the house is ready. I want to begin the plans
to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Dan, a year anyway! Whatever will Granny
do?”</p>

<p>“Move her into the hotel,” he promised generously.
“But you’ve got to marry me in September! Let’s go
over to Philena’s grave and pledge it.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think I deserve you, you’re so much in earnest,
but I am sort of playing a lovely, interesting part—a
wonderful part, too, but I’d really like to have strangers
here to see how well I do it,” Thurley tried to explain as
they came up to a white cross newer than the surrounding
markers on which was engraved:</p>

<p class="center">Philena, beloved grandchild of Betsey Pilrig,<br />
Young, beautiful and good, God numbered her among His angels<br />
At the early age of fifteen!</p>

<p>“Now promise,” Dan insisted, holding her hands.</p>

<p>“I promise,” Thurley answered. Leaning over the
cross, they kissed each other with tender solemnity.</p>

<p>“Shall we sit here and talk,” Thurley asked, “or walk
back?”</p>

<p>“Anything you like. You’re so beautiful to-day,
Thurley, I wonder if you realize how beautiful you are!
I’m going to make you wear the proper sort of clothes and
send right off for your ring.”</p>

<p>Thurley glanced at her pink cotton blouse and white
wash skirt in disdain. “I hate bothering over clothes
and yet I’d like rich, weird creations just dropped from
the skies. I never could sit and sew like—”</p>

<p>“Lorraine, I suppose!” Dan laughed in spite of
himself. “I want to walk over to the <cite>Gazette</cite> office and put<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
our engagement notice in. I wouldn’t want that to go by
another week, if I had to get out an extry. I believe I’d
make them get out an extry, too!”</p>

<p>“Did the <cite>Gazette</cite> ever get out an extry for anything?”
she asked.</p>

<p>“The nearest they ever came to it was when Ali Baba
was learning to ride a wheel and he ran into a barrel of
tar pitch within half an hour of four o’clock! Come on,
sweetheart, we can begin planning furniture.”</p>

<p>Thurley lingered near an old tombstone with the engraving:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Naked as from the earth we came,</div>
<div class="verse">And crept to life at first,</div>
<div class="verse">We to the earth return again,</div>
<div class="verse">And mingle with our dust.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“I love a graveyard,” she said pensively. “I like to
sing in one.”</p>

<p>“Sing for me now.” Dan was anxious to comply with
her slightest wish.</p>

<p>“This is a queer one to sing, up here,” she answered,
beginning,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">The ship goes sailing down the bay,</div>
<div class="verse">Good-by, my lover good-by—</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Dan was not thinking of the song; he was thinking of
Thurley as his bespoken wife and of his and Thurley’s
life together. Singing was to be a minor thing which
should take place while babies were rocked to sleep or
perhaps on Easter Sunday for the special anthem. Dan
had no idea of allowing her to remain a paid soloist—but
it would do to tell her so later!</p>

<p>“Bravo,” he said as she finished. “Shall we go
along?” tucking her arm under his with a masterful air.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>They trudged down the pathway to the road. Some
children were picking the last berries from the dusty
bushes; when they caught sight of Thurley, they ran
towards her, saying,</p>

<p>“Miss Clergy heard you sing. Her carriage just went
on. She had Ali Baba stop so’s she could hear. She
stuck her head out the window and asked him your name
and Dan’s name and he told her, and then she stuck her
head in and he drove on.”</p>

<p>“There’s an old woman who ought to be ashamed to
act like she has for years and years,” Dan began.</p>

<p>But Thurley did not answer. Presently she said, “So—I
had an audience even in a graveyard. Dan, do you
know Miss Clergy never asks questions about any one?
She must have liked my voice!”</p>

<p>“She’ll never get the chance to hear it again! I’ll
race you to that first oak—”</p>

<p>Thurley shook her head. “Wait, Dan, I feel queer
inside ... as if something might come of it, I don’t
know just what.”</p>

<p>“Are you going to let a crazy old woman’s listening to
you sing stop our getting to the newspaper office in time
to announce our engagement?”</p>

<p>“Dan, do you realize that we are both ‘Corners’ people
and they never do get along? A house or a store on
the corner always attracts the most attention and gets the
most notice paid to it and that is why your father’s people
founded these Corners and you have to be a Corners person—people
just naturally pay you attention or you
know why ... and I’m a Corners person, too.”</p>

<p>“I said I was not going to listen to your nonsense.
I’ll kiss you right in sight of this farmer’s team,” he
warned. “You’re going to belong to me and that is all
that matters.”</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<p>“Gosh, you should see the tilt of his gold-banded
cigar,” was Ali Baba’s comment to Hopeful the day the
engagement was announced with a special heading, and
also the fact that “Mr. Birge has begun plans for building
his permanent residence on the beautiful site overlooking
the lake. It is understood it will be named Fairview
in accordance with Miss Precore’s wishes and elaborate
furnishings have been ordered from New York.”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry for Lorraine,” Hopeful answered, “but I
bet a cookie ’Raine goes to see Thurley and takes her an
embroidered set for a present. She’s as brave as a lion
and sweet as an angel! And I bet you a mince pie Thurley
Precore isn’t going to be happy.”</p>

<p>“You ain’t sayin’ anything against Thurley?” demanded
Ali Baba.</p>

<p>“Land, no, I set a sight by Thurley the same as by
Lorraine, and I like Dan as well as either of ’em. It’s
just a mistake, Ali Baba, and you know what mistakes in
love do.” Her hand pointed in the direction of the
upper front rooms. “Well, wait and see. Thurley was
meant always to sing for her supper, the same as Lorraine
was made to cook supper for a good man.”</p>

<p>“I guess Dan ain’t different from all men—made to
<em>eat</em> supper no matter how much singin’ or cookin’ goes to
gettin’ the vittles on the table,” was Ali Baba’s emphatic
summary of the situation.</p>

<p class="tb">Lorraine did call on Thurley and bring a daintily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
wrapped blue tissue paper parcel containing one of her
embroidered “sets” for the washstand of any conventional,
country spare room. Lorraine had remained with
the older generation in her standards of house furnishings
and necessities.</p>

<p>The blue tissue paper matched her blue batiste frock
with its crisp ruffles and the ribbon on her hat. Lorraine
had made the dress and trimmed the hat, and it gave the
impression of good taste and praiseworthy industry.
There was nothing Lorraine could or would not attempt
to do, once convinced it was her duty. She had the angelic
sweetness of really unselfish natures and the accompanying
stubbornness of which martyrs are made. She
was a trifle weak, perhaps, during a crisis, and certainly
lacked Thurley’s aggression and power of argument.
But Lorraine could sustain a situation—long after Thurley
was forced, by temperament, to abandon it! Not
even her estimable father dreamed that on the day Lorraine’s
mother died, the child soul of her had closed and
grownups scratched on it in vain. It was her duty, she
was convinced, not to mourn openly.</p>

<p>It had been her father’s duty to have Lorraine brought
up, and a maiden aunt’s duty to forego the luxury of her
severe but unhampered existence to see that Lorraine was
properly raised. And it was Lorraine’s duty to repay the
bringing up and to take the place of the minister’s wife
and be the minister’s daughter at the same time, to entertain
deacons and visiting circuit riders and ladies’ aid societies
alike, to clean the best room for the missionaries
and cook for them and pray for the conversion of the
heathen all in the same day, to be not too prominent
as the minister’s daughter and yet to take the necessary
lead in all things even unto making a house to house
canvass to solicit her father’s back salary or enough<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
knives and forks to serve the entire congregation at the
baked bean supper!</p>

<p>Likewise, it was her duty not to think how pretty she
was—that frail, elusive sort of beauty which does not
impress the first time one meets it but which, after one
has become familiar with it, fairly coaxes its way into the
heart to remain. (No one having merely “glimpsed”
Thurley would have ever forgotten her!) Because Lorraine
had innocent, dove-colored eyes and the fairest of
fair hair and tilted features with dimples placed irregularly
about, she was misjudged as to her abilities. No
one would have dreamed that the girl painstakingly wrote
the burden of her father’s letters and helped to soften his
harshest of sermons, particularly those on predestination
and heresy, and then turned into the kitchen to do the
work of stout-elbowed women! Nor did that comprise
all of her duty. To her fell those prosaic, uninteresting
tasks such as taking old shoes to be mended in order
to avoid buying new, or re-lining her father’s threadbare
coats or rummaging endless drawers to find a recipe for
walnut catsup to satisfy some bromidic but important
sister of the church.</p>

<p>It was her duty not to love Dan too hard and become
a sentimental goose, she told herself as night after night
she wrestled with her conscience, trying not to hate Thurley
Precore as such small, dainty creatures, to every one’s
surprise, can hate. Of course Dan would marry Thurley
or else marry no one; he would build the lovely home
for her and buy her endless pretty clothes, for every
one knew Thurley could not even darn stockings skilfully—she
admitted it with one of her boyish laughs!
He would also buy her a new automobile and a concert
grand piano; and she would be his loved and
trusted wife, mother of his children, and when Lorraine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
would come to this part of her reverie, the dimples
would become quivering dents of emotion and the orthodox
prayers her father fancied were being said would
vanish completely. Of course, she would comfort herself,
Thurley would never make Dan happy—she sang
too well! Even this was salt in the wound, for was not
Thurley paid soloist at her father’s church and was
not Lorraine obliged to sit Sunday after Sunday in the
first pew and listen to Thurley’s wonderful voice sing glorious
anthems while behind Lorraine was Dan Birge,
present only because he could take Thurley home?...
And Lorraine had to say to him, because it was more of
her duty, “Good morning, Dan; wasn’t the solo wonderful?
I think Thurley’s voice is better all the time.
Good morning, Thurley dear, we’ve just been saying what
a marvel you are—good-by. Oh, good morning, Mrs.
Turner, I want to thank you for the invitation for the
quilting party—yes, I’d love to come—oh, thank
you—” and so on, her heart thumping uncontrollably
fast.</p>

<p>After greeting the congregation, she must go into the
parsonage and cook dinner and try to eat as she listened
to her father’s small talk; she must wash the dishes and
return to the church to teach the Bible class in the three
o’clock Sabbath school—while all the time she knew Dan
and Thurley were whirling about the lovely hilly country,
stopping at some shady, brook-embraced glen to eat their
luncheon and make love! And again, a cold tea at six
and Lorraine must once more play scullery maid and then
go into the evening service and know Dan was behind her
waiting impatiently until Thurley’s duties were ended and
they might go back to Betsey Pilrig’s porch or parlor and
with mellow moonlight as witness—<em>spoon!</em> That was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
the truth—spoon! Lorraine’s flat little chest would
heave excitedly and she would drop her eyes and force
herself to count the dots in her frock—the third summer
for it—to steady herself until she could glance up at
Thurley in the choir loft and realize that she was the
gladdest, loveliest thing in two worlds, a wild rose by all
the poets’ dictionaries!</p>

<p>So when she climbed the hill to Betsey Pilrig’s house
and Betsey went to call Thurley, Lorraine sank into the
parlor chair and gave vent to a faint groan. If it were
any other girl save Thurley, she could endure it more
easily, but Thurley was so careless of his love, she so
undervalued it! She heard Thurley humming a gay
song and running down the stairs.</p>

<p>“You nice creature!” Thurley said carelessly, kissing
her and trying to remove her hat at the same time. “Do
take it off, ’Raine, it’s such a climb up here. There, now
I can see your eyes!” Thurley did not realize how unkind
was this last. “Sit there—it’s a comfy chair—well,
I know what you’ve come to say,” she blushed properly,
“but if Dan could see me I know he’d be quite
shocked, I look anything but a prospective young matron—’fess
up, ’Raine!”</p>

<p>Lorraine shook her head. “Dan wouldn’t care how
you looked as long as you would marry him,” she began
bravely. “You know that.” It was harder than she
had steeled herself to expect. Thurley was so careless
of her great joy, she seemed a strange creature not belonging
to any well-ordered town as she sat gracefully on
the arm of a sofa, her dark hair braided about her head
and the rumpled pink linen frock emphasizing the color
of her cheeks.</p>

<p>“Well, maybe not. I’m hoping he’ll always feel that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
way. I didn’t want to announce it, but Dan wouldn’t
wait any longer. Of course we’ve been half engaged for
about two years.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know.” Lorraine wondered if her voice
sounded metallic.</p>

<p>“So I said yes, and now Dan is neglecting business.
He was here at half-past eight this morning to ask if I
wanted the walls tinted or papered; and he’s gone right
ahead and ordered a most extravagant ring—two carat
in platinum—really, I don’t approve for I’m so careless
of all my things I’m bound to lose it. I’d rather he
didn’t start the house either. If I were only like you, I’d
be delighted with the prospect of a pantry and a million
shelves and drawers and the promise of any sort of range
or fireless cooker and all the other appliances, but I’m not
even interested.”</p>

<p>“You’re not? Why, Thurley, Dan will have to eat!
What does interest you?”</p>

<p>“The garden and the color of my room and, most of
all, my piano. For I’m to have a baby grand piano of
my very own—I won’t have to practise on the Sunday
school piano any more. I’m half afraid I’m marrying
Dan for that piano—don’t look shocked—I’m not, of
course, only it means a great deal.”</p>

<p>“I can’t imagine it! But of course I haven’t your
voice.” Unconsciously Lorraine glanced out the window
and across the road to where, sinking into comfortable
ruin, stood a tottering old box-car wagon, the one in
which Thurley had travelled all the way from Boulder,
Colorado!</p>

<p>“I wish Philena were here, she’d have so loved a wedding,”
Thurley said presently, “and Granny wouldn’t be
so lonesome. Did I tell you that Dan says she’s to have
his old rooms at the hotel, unless she’ll live with us? She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
says she won’t, so, of course, the other way is easy and
lovely for her.”</p>

<p>“He’s very generous,” Lorraine sighed. She held out
her parcel. “It is just a well-wisher, as we say,” she
added. “Nothing, of course, like your other things will
be, but I made it myself and perhaps you will like it because
of that.”</p>

<p>Lorraine had embroidered faint dreams and hopes of
some day using the set in her house—and Dan Birge’s—into
the pattern. She had many such trifles tucked away
in a chest of walnut drawers.</p>

<p>“You’re a dear—I’m so clumsy with a needle—and
it is beautiful!” Thurley said as she opened the package.
“Just fancy you doing all this! Oh, Lorraine, I’ve told
Dan, so many times, ‘You ought to marry Lorraine instead
of me—she’d make you such a good wife.’ But
men don’t pay any attention to common sense when
they’re in love,” she rattled on.</p>

<p>“Did you, really?” Lorraine put her little hand on
Thurley’s sleeve.</p>

<p>“Dozens of times.”</p>

<p>“And did—did Dan ever answer you?”</p>

<p>Thurley turned to look thoughtfully at her small guest.
“Well,” she began awkwardly, “he said that he just happened
to love me. I suppose it’s that way lots of times—people
love certain people whether it’s best or not.
When you come to see me, this set shall be in the best
room I have—truly. And I want you to teach me lots
of things you know—cooking and sewing and how always
to be even tempered. Why, I’m cross as a witch
one minute and jolly as a gypsy the next, and I do want to
make him happy!” There was an earnest catch in her
voice. “He’s been so good to me—I’ve nothing to
offer him but myself.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>“That is all he wants,” Lorraine made herself answer,
reaching for her hat. “Are you going to sing any other
place besides church?”</p>

<p>“I think so; Dan thinks not. After all, if you have
some one who loves you very much and is always willing
to listen to you sing, I suppose you ought to do as he
says.”</p>

<p>“How can you do anything he doesn’t wish you to?”
Lorraine asked passionately. “You’d be wicked—with
him loving you so hard!” Then, ashamed of her confession,
she said a confused good-by and hurried out in
time to have a ride with a passing farmer.</p>

<p>Thurley took the “set” to show to Betsey Pilrig.
“See what ’Raine has given your lazy Thurley,” she said
penitently. “I’m beginning to feel out of sorts with myself—I
don’t know why. As if I ought to have been
making wedding clothes when she called or scalding over
preserves or something like that, instead of staying upstairs
and learning a new opera aria. Granny, aren’t you
sorry you let this long-legged, noisy creature stay in your
house?” She knelt beside the old woman and clasped
her arms around Betsey’s waist.</p>

<p>Betsey shook her head. “No, because Philena loved
you—and when Philena died, she told me to take care of
you.”</p>

<p>“And now I’m going to take care of <em>you</em>, and you’re
never going to work.”</p>

<p>She rose and walked into the parlor, opening the sacred
shutters wide and seating herself at the old-time organ
with its carpet-covered pedals and apricot plush stool.
She began playing chords, her blue eyes looking across
the road, beyond the old box-car wagon, as if she saw
visions of worlds still to be conquered—the worlds that
the child Thurley had pledged herself to know.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>There was little in Betsey Pilrig’s house of value to
Thurley, but mere furnishings never mattered. She was
oblivious to shabby carpets, and, when she dusted the parlor
furniture or set the table with nicked and varied
styles of china, she was too busy singing or thinking of
Dan to notice her actual surroundings. Nor did clothes
bother Thurley—she was happy in a white middy blouse
and a serge skirt and quite as beautiful as if she wore a
Paquin creation. Besides, Thurley rebelled at taking
help from Betsey Pilrig and her only way of earning
money was limited. Even if one was the best singer and
piano teacher in the township with the commendation of
having learned: first, all Kate Sills knew, which ended
with an E flat valse and “Dixie” with variations; and,
second, all that a small city organist could teach her during
his summer vacation spent in the Corners, and, last,
all Thurley herself taught herself by diligent practice and
“just coming natural to her”—even so, who wanted to
pay more than twenty-five cents an hour to learn how to
sing or play on the piano? So Thurley was forced to
content herself with being organist, choir mistress and
soloist in the church, with a dozen pupils to round out her
income. Whenever she begged Dan to let her clerk in
his store, he always asked her to marry him, thus blockading
her desire.</p>

<p>With a restless gesture she closed the organ. “Ho-hum,
I need Dan to make love to me,” she ruminated.
“I can’t seem to make myself take anything seriously. I
wonder why God made the Precores stop off here instead
of a city—things would have been different in a city....”
A moment later she mentally upbraided herself,
“As if you weren’t the luckiest girl in the world! You
ought to get down on your knees and ask poor ’Raine to
forgive you, and Dan and Granny, too.... Go out and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
start a patchwork quilt this instant and don’t let a single
song be heard in this house until it is a third finished!”</p>

<p>But the scolding seemed to have no effect, for, instead,
she reopened the organ and sang the opera aria she had
just learned. As she finished it, she spied Miss Clergy’s
shabby coupé pausing behind the clump of maple trees.</p>

<p>“Why—that’s the second time within a few days!”
Thurley said delightedly. “Now—I wonder....”</p>

<p class="tb">With the exception of paying her wages or making
some childish complaint, Abigail Clergy seldom spoke to
Hopeful. It was an event to be summoned into those
always lighted, seldom aired front rooms, crowded with
keepsakes of a bygone generation, to stand before the
chair of the imperious creature in her rusty black silk and
hear her upbraidings over the fact that harmless urchins
had been seen crossing the Fincherie lawn.</p>

<p>During the first tedious years of Miss Clergy’s self-imprisonment,
Hopeful, then younger and stronger of
spirit, used to remonstrate against the order of things,
urge a new doctor, a jaunt to the seaside, even if she saw
no one. She tried to persuade Miss Clergy to wear new
gowns, to turn off the penetrating gaslights which burned
day and night no matter how bright the sun or how mellow
the moon, to open the windows and let the fresh air
revive her spirits, read a daily paper and, gradually,
gently be swept back into the current of everyday living.</p>

<p>To none of these suggestions did Miss Clergy lend
anything but a deaf ear. Her life had become her
martyrdom and she did not propose to lose a single jot
of it. With the exception of Ali Baba, who had
proved himself faithful beyond a doubt, Miss Clergy
had registered an everlasting hatred and distrust of
men, it mattered not who. No clergyman dared enter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
her door; her physicians were women, her lawyers
acted as if they had been sentenced to the gallows
and were merely enjoying a brief stay of execution. No
man could ever command even her respect, she had told
Hopeful; no woman could have her confidence or her
love. She hated all living creatures. And as the years
passed with Miss Clergy a trifle more wrinkled of skin,
whiter of hair and distorted of mind, Hopeful ceased
making efforts to change her viewpoint. Indeed, she,
too, fell into a sort of charmed, even existence, free from
material want or keenness of interest in the world without.
The Clergy fortune continued to multiply. All
Miss Clergy had to do was figuratively to wave a yellowed,
jewelled hand and a barrel of gold was at her command.
Yet no repairs were permitted to be made at the
Fincherie, not even a new coupé nor for Ali Baba a new
livery. And when, one by one, the old mares would die
and the purchase of another was inevitable, Miss Clergy
would fly into a rage.</p>

<p>When, perforce, Hopeful demanded to clean the two
front rooms, Miss Clergy would scold sharply, as she
moved into one of them, waiting with added martyrdom
until she could fly back into the other to complain about
some minute change in the placing of a book or the position
of a chair.</p>

<p>The rest of the house, however, was left to Hopeful’s
guardianship, and, when she tried to persuade Miss
Clergy to come downstairs and sit in the pleasant parlors
or eat in the little breakfast room, Miss Clergy would
demand,</p>

<p>“Do you want to find another home for yourself,
Hopeful? Oh, you do not. Then leave me in peace—at
least I am mistress of my own house.”</p>

<p>She never spoke to Ali Baba save the daily, “An hour’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
drive, Ali Baba, not too fast,” and by the world at large
she was never even seen. No charity appeal softened
her selfish, useless vigil; no cause, however worthy, could
lessen her hysterical mimicry of disease. No one was
the better for the existence of that small, sinister person
with a withered heart, since it was no longer even bruised.</p>

<p>And when, on the evening of the day Miss Clergy had
stopped for the second time to hear Thurley sing, she
rang the bell long after Hopeful had served her a tray
supper and said almost civilly as she entered, “Sit down,
Hopeful. I want to ask you about a girl named Thurley
Precore who sings—who she is and how she earns her
living and how long she has been here,” Hopeful put her
tired hand to her head, wondering if she had heard aright.</p>

<p>With a tyrannical smile Miss Clergy repeated her questions.</p>

<p>So Hopeful found her voice after a bit and began the
story of Thurley’s singing for her supper up to the time
her father died when the first snow flew and how out of
charity Betsey Pilrig had taken her into her home to live
with Philena.</p>

<p>“Of course Betsey didn’t have much, but what she had
she divided between Philena and Thurley, and she’s said
to me that she looked on Thurley as the boy and Philena
the girl. Because Thurley is one of those that’ll get
themselves heard, if they’re born in the backwoods.
There wasn’t much to Philena but her big eyes and her
crutch, and you ought to have seen the way Thurley
looked out for her and toted her on her back, pretending
she wasn’t heavy! My land, I’ve watched those
children play together until I was late with my work!”</p>

<p>“What did they play?” interrupted Miss Clergy.</p>

<p>“Missionary and play-actin’ and all such stuff, and
Thurley made it up. No matter what Thurley made up,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
Philena said she liked it. I never will forget the Christmas
Philena made a travellin’ chest for Thurley out of
an ol’ tea-box she got down to Submit Curler’s store!
She fitted it up inside with cretonne pockets and a lookin’
glass and wrote on a card, ‘For Thurley when she goes
to be a missionary!’ Wasn’t that the queerest thing for
a young ’un to think of? Philena was to be a missionary,
too, and Thurley was to sing the songs. Oh, Thurley
can sing! When they graduated from the high school—Philena
didn’t live long after that—Philena read a
graduating essay and Thurley sang a song and there
wasn’t no applause for Philena, except what me and
Betsey and Ali Baba mustered up, but everybody stamped
their feet to have Thurley come back and sing. There
was a sort of tableau, too, at the church, for Children’s
Sunday—seven children were the seven days of the
week, and wasn’t it queer that Thurley was Saturday,
Philena was Sunday and Lorraine McDowell, Monday?”</p>

<p>“What of it?” snapped Miss Clergy.</p>

<p>“It means that ‘Saturday’s child must work for a
living’ and Thurley said, ‘That’s me—Saturday.’
And ‘Sunday’s child is full of grace,’ and certainly
Philena was, and ‘Monday’s child is fair of face,’ and
nobody would ever want to see a prettier child than Lorraine
was—or is—”</p>

<p>“Never mind her! Go on about Thurley,” Hopeful
was ordered.</p>

<p>“It was the next month Philena died, and Betsey spent
half she had in the bank to bury her the way she thought
she’d like—a lavender coffin with quilted satin and she
wore her graduating dress and a jet hair ornament that
Thurley give her and Thurley sang at the funeral and
never broke down onct! Some say Thurley Precore
never loved no one, but I know she loved Philena, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
since then she stayed on at Betsey’s and earned money
singin’ and teachin’ piano and it seems as if she couldn’t
put her mind on nothin’ else ... I dunno—”</p>

<p>“Who’s the—boy?” There was a rasping tone in
her voice. “The boy she is engaged to marry?”</p>

<p>“Why, Dan Birge—”</p>

<p>“Birge—” memories stirred in the numbed brain.</p>

<p>“Grandson of the one you knew, Miss Abby. Dearie
me, you’ve lost count of years!” Hopeful shook her
head.</p>

<p>“Will she be fool enough to marry him?” Miss Clergy
insisted.</p>

<p>“He’ll marry no one else, I guess. Seems as if he’s
always cared for her and she’s made a man of him, too.”</p>

<p>“That will do, Hopeful. The omelette was like
leather and don’t put flowers on my tray again.” Miss
Clergy’s dismissal was as brusque as her greeting.</p>

<p>Below, Ali Baba and Hopeful exchanged opinions.
After thirty some years of seclusion Abby Clergy had
begun to care to hear of some one else.</p>

<p>“Well, if any one else could make her care, it would
be Thurley,” Ali Baba deduced, while Hopeful paused
in the wiping of the last pot to say sagely,</p>

<p>“If she could, she’d have Dan Birge blown off the
face of the earth, just because he wants to marry Thurley.”</p>

<p>“Some wimmen takes it harder’n others,” muttered Ali
Baba whose patience with Miss Clergy was not of the
same duration as his cousin Hopeful’s.</p>

<p>For the first time in thirty-some years Abby Clergy
actually opened the shutter of her window and let in
the summer breeze. She drew a chair close beside it
and rested her thin arms on the window ledge. A flush
in the yellowed cheeks betrayed her excitement; her harsh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
voice was trying to hum the aria Thurley had sung so
carelessly that afternoon. By chance it was the solo
aria in the last opera Abby Clergy had seen. She had
been escorted by Sebastian Gomez the pretender, and
every one had turned opera glasses to look at this
beautiful American girl who was to marry a supposedly
dashing nobleman, according to newspaper gossips.
What time and happenings had occurred since then!
And Thurley, who had stirred the last spark of life in
the embers of Miss Abby’s heart, was to marry a country
bumpkin, a Birge, a storekeeper probably, a slangy, serge-suited,
whistling nuisance with an odious bulldog and
a new-fangled automobile—never! Not if the Clergy
fortune could prevent it!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<p>Busied with her “penance” of quilting, the next day,
Thurley was summoned by a peremptory rap at the side
door. It was Ali Baba, his shabby silk hat laid across
his heart after the fashion of pictures of cavaliers which
he had chanced to see in old-time novels.</p>

<p>“I’ve an invitation from the queen,” he said with a
bit of dry humor. “After she heard you sing, she wants
to tell you how you please her. Don’t refuse or we’ll
all be beheaded in the tower! Thurley dear, I’m a silly
old man—what I mean is that Abigail Clergy wants you
to drive with her. She won’t harm you—she’s as
sane as you or I—only she heard you sing and she liked
it. For land’s sake and Mrs. Davis, don’t refuse!
We’d lose the one chance of maybe makin’ her be her own
self again. Never mind a hat; just go out to the coupé
and drive about with her. Let her talk to you!” The
hand which held the silk hat trembled from excitement.</p>

<p>To have lived with a haunted creature for over thirty
years and suddenly have that haunted creature express
a normal desire was nothing less than terrifying to the
two aged servitors.</p>

<p>“Me? Drive with Abby Clergy? Ali Baba, sure it’s
not a joke? Come? Of course I will,” and with no
more thought for her “penance,” Thurley danced out of
the house, down the flagstone walk and with an abrupt,
determined hand opened the door of the curtained coupé.</p>

<p>Trembling with excitement herself, Miss Clergy managed
to extend her hand. “I wanted to tell you something,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
Thurley Precore,” she began. “Ali Baba—an
hour’s drive—not too fast!” this a discreet hint to Ali
Baba that eavesdropping was not to be tolerated, and,
as Melba stalked down the road, injured to the last
buckle of her shining harness at the extra weight thrust
upon her, Thurley turned an unaffectedly delighted face
to Miss Clergy and said,</p>

<p>“What in the world is it? You’ve no idea how larky
it is to drive with you—I’ve made up stories about you
ever since I found my way into your house years ago—the
side way—and you ran after me,” her clear, musical
laugh seemed to clear the atmosphere of excited unrest.</p>

<p>“So it was you! Strange ... never mind myself—tell
me, have you always sung like this?”</p>

<p>“Of course! I can’t help it any more than to
breathe.”</p>

<p>“You have no relatives—no one nearer than Betsey
Pilrig?”</p>

<p>Thurley admitted sorrowfully that she had not.</p>

<p>“Nor money?”</p>

<p>“Not a penny! But I’m the happiest pauper alive.”</p>

<p>“I hear you are to marry,” Miss Clergy’s voice broke
as she said the words, “the Birge boy? My dear, I’m
not so old as I seem, but I had a great sorrow when I
was younger than you and it changed everything. I’ve
never chosen to explain to the world, since I was not dependent
on it, and if I preferred to live alone and brood,
it was my right. But this much do I know, and because
you are young and have a God-given talent, I shall tell
you. You are a fool—as great a fool in your way as
I was in mine to trust the man who cheated me—to
marry a country boy and try to be content. You’ll be
running off with the first goodlooking stranger that
comes your way ... ah, but I know, times never have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
changed women’s hearts. They eloped years ago by a
team of fast horses, and now they do it by the aid of an
automobile, and in a little while they’ll be eloping in a
flying machine. You see, I’m not so queer as people say,
I’ve kept up a bit! Birges have bad tempers. I knew
the grandfather, and they are Englishmen regarding their
wives. You can sing and you are young and spirited;
you should go away to New York and have teachers and
the chance to become great. I am not telling you this
to break your engagement, but from your eyes I see that
singing is as dear to you as Daniel Birge or you would
have stopped me when I first mentioned his name. Is
that not so?”</p>

<p>“Quite,” said Thurley simply.</p>

<p>“Then remember this! Should some disagreement
come between you two, I could not say what,” she
shrugged her black shoulders and waved the withered
hands with their flashing rings, “say, if you wanted to
sing and he tried to prevent you from so doing—as all
beasts of men try to cheat women of the things dearest
to them,” her teeth made a grinding, unpleasant noise,
“if you should be brave enough and big enough, as I
think you would be, to tell this boy to go his way and
you with your voice would go yours, come to me, Thurley!
I may be odd, but I am very rich, and your singing
has made me realize I’m a lonesome old woman.
I’d like nothing better, my child, than to take you to
New York to make you the success God intended. Don’t
thank me. It is not goodness of heart—not half so
much as revenge. If you came with Dan Birge’s child
in your arms and told me he was out of work and you
needed aid, I’m afraid I would have a deaf ear. But
I want to cheat some man of the woman he loves, to
turn the tables. This boy loves you in his over-colored,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
peasant way. It would break his heart, as nearly as
any man’s heart can be broken, to have you leave him.
It would sting his pride and scratch his vanity—”</p>

<p>“But Dan is true blue, Miss Clergy! I couldn’t
hurt him to please any one.”</p>

<p>“No, but if he forbade your singing—as he will—and
you were lucky enough to find it out before you
married him instead of afterwards—what then?
Would you meekly lock your piano and follow him into
the kitchen? What then? Speak up, my girl! Remember,
I am not trying to cause trouble. I ask you
only for the promise. Should you have an argument
with your—your lover, come to me; do not weaken!
I am rich—and lonesome—and your voice has made
me know I want to love some one again—just before I
die. I’ll let you out here, my dear. You can scamper
back. Don’t forget, will you, Thurley?”</p>

<p>She pressed the tube for Ali Baba to halt. Thurley,
bewildered, impressed, angered, yet amused, all in one,
knew that yellowed lips brushed her fresh cheek, and,
when she looked up to say good-by, there were tears in
Abby Clergy’s restless eyes!</p>

<p>Fate sometimes pursues people, even if they are not
willing to be pursued. Certainly it was fate pursued
Thurley Precore. As she came to Betsey Pilrig’s gate
tingling with excitement, inclined to laugh and then to
protest against the abuse of Dan, and, finally, to cry a
little like a true woman, she glanced in the letter-box
to find an offer from Rufus Westcott, manager of the
South Wales county fair. He asked if Thurley would
sing during fair week at five dollars a night, and to let
him know as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Betsey Pilrig wondered why Thurley stayed so long
at the gate reading her letter. But only Thurley knew!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
Miss Clergy had spoken barely in time. An hour before
and Thurley would have said to Dan,</p>

<p>“Please let me. You can take me home every night—I
want to—there’s no harm and it’s such a lark—please,”
and would have ended in being coaxed out
of her desire.</p>

<p>But she marched into the dining-room, and, sitting at
the table, opened a writing pad and picked up a pencil.
Fate did not even let her wait for ink! She accepted
Mr. Westcott’s offer with pleasure and would send him
her programme of songs inside of two days.</p>

<p>Signing her name, she glanced up to see Betsey Pilrig
standing in the doorway.</p>

<p>“Thurley, you look up to mischief! Where have
you been?”</p>

<p>Thurley sealed the envelope with an emphatic little
thump, “I can’t tell you until I’ve told Dan.”</p>

<p>“I guess as long as you tell Dan first, I can wait,”
Betsey answered.</p>

<p>But had she witnessed the telling she would not have
complacently made beaten biscuit, wondering if Dan was
coming home for supper with Thurley.</p>

<p>For Thurley, racing impatiently back from the post
office to keep her daily tryst with Dan, had come upon
him returning from the cemetery.</p>

<p>“You’re an hour late,” he complained.</p>

<p>She started to explain and then something kept “ticking”
these words into her head like an insistent clock,
“I am rich and lonesome and your voice has made me
know I want to love some one again.” So all she answered
was,</p>

<p>“Must I account to you for every moment?” flinging
herself down by the road and playing with Zaza.</p>

<p>Although he felt he ought to tower down at her in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
conventional, jealous rage, Dan seated himself meekly beside
her. “Why, I didn’t mean it that way! Only
you’re never late and I worried. I was afraid you were
hurt. You are going to be my wife and I’ve the right
to ask questions. What’s wrong, dear? Your eyes are
like stars and your cheeks as pink as your dress! You
look as if you’d found some one you liked better than
you do me,” he could not refrain from adding. “Do
you know I’m terribly envious of any one you like at all?
I’d like to lock away all your smiles for myself.”</p>

<p>“Silly,” reproached Thurley, as she trailed a stick
in front of Zaza. “As if I couldn’t have personal errands.
I don’t go asking you where you are every minute
in the day—”</p>

<p>“I’d rather you did than to seem not to care.” He
tried to put his arm around her, but she drew away.</p>

<p>“Don’t! It’s terribly childish to make love at every
fence corner. Let’s be dignified—not boy and girl
style! I don’t like it any more.”</p>

<p>“You used to,” he objected.</p>

<p>“Oh, no, it was just the young of me that liked excitement.
There isn’t any excitement at the Corners unless
the gods happen to favor one. I’ve been thinking
for a long time I should not have been so lazy as I am,
staying at Granny’s and hardly earning my ‘keep.’”</p>

<p>“Have you been reading more silly books?”</p>

<p>“Dan, suppose we quarreled! Well, just suppose we
did—and Miss Clergy, the funny old lady at the Fincherie,
took it into her head that she wanted to give me
a chance to learn how to sing and talk and dance and all
the things that are just crying inside of me to be learned!
Oh, Dan, dear, don’t look like that! I’m just supposing.
And suppose I decided to let her take me to New York—and
our engagement was broken, would you care so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
terribly?” The latent maternal in Thurley was asking
the question; it lacked the usual ruse of the vapid coquette.</p>

<p>He looked as if he scarcely comprehended what she
had said. Then he answered, “Don’t suppose that way.
Something inside me would just <em>die</em>.”</p>

<p>Thurley’s handsome eyebrows drew together in a
straight line. “Dan,” she added a moment later, “I’ve
promised Rufus Westcott, the county fair manager, to
sing at the South Wales fair every night. Do you
mind?”</p>

<p>“Never!” he cried, standing up. “So that’s what has
caused this talk? I’ll not let my future wife sing at a
county fair with painted dancers and half-drunken fakirs!
What do you think I am?”</p>

<p>“I’m not your wife yet,” she retorted, angry youth
rising to face angry youth, and tender love quite helpless
between them! “I’ve written and promised—I
just posted the letter.”</p>

<p>“You didn’t even ask me!” he accused.</p>

<p>“Why should I ask you?”</p>

<p>“Because I love you! I’d ask you about anything I
was going to do, you know that. How much did he offer
you? I’ll double it, if you say no.”</p>

<p>She shook her head. “If you gave me five hundred
dollars, I’d not be bribed. It isn’t the money. It’s the
joy of singing to people—but you can’t understand.”</p>

<p>“You belong to me and you shall not do it!” The
Birge temper was gaining control of the good-natured,
generous boy. “Do you hear me?”</p>

<p>“I belong to whom I choose! Don’t look at me like
that! Do you think I’ll marry a man so narrow-minded
that he refuses me the chance to sing in respectable fashion?
Better women than I have done so.” The Precore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
temper was matching the Birge temper without hesitation.</p>

<p>“I won’t give my consent,” Dan said in a dangerous
tone. “If you sing at that fair, by God—I—I won’t
marry you!” Then his face went white as soon as he
had spoken. “Oh, no, of course I,” he began piteously,
“Thurley—listen—don’t do it, will you—”</p>

<p>Thurley’s eyes were closed for a moment. She saw in
tempting panorama the old coupé with Miss Clergy saying
good-by and adding, “I am rich and lonesome
and—”</p>

<p>She opened them to look with impersonal scorn at
Dan Birge. In that brief interlude he became a presuming,
ill-tempered, small-town man who would drive
her into becoming an equally ill-tempered, small-town
woman—she would have none of it!</p>

<p>“Very well,” she answered, drawing off the seal ring
which she was wearing until the solitaire was ready,
“you’ve said it—not I. Good-by and I hope you’ll be
happy.”</p>

<p>She turned and walked in the opposite direction. At
first Dan started to follow; then he threw back his head
with the same insolent toss as Thurley’s, and, squaring
off his shoulders, walked in the direction of the hotel.
Of course their engagement was <em>not</em> broken; that was
too absurd even to fancy. But Thurley must know, first
as well as last, that when she married Dan his wishes
were to count. Lovely, wilful Thurley-girl, what a wonderful
time of it they would have making up! Of course
nothing would <em>really</em> interfere with the September wedding—impish
and unwelcome thought. It was just that
Thurley must see he was in the right, and, when she
sang, it would be in her husband’s house—the twenty-thousand-dollar
house with the statue of a deer in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
front and a pergola and steam heat! He would go up to
see Thurley that same night and they would begin all new
again and he would write Westcott on a typewriter and
on the store official paper and explain that Miss Precore
could not keep her engagement. His Thurley singing
at a county fair—never!</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<p>Then the second thrilling event happened! Like all
thrilling events it happened with magical speed. First, it
was carefully reported by Ali Baba and Hopeful that
Thurley Precore had unceremoniously arrived at The Fincherie
and demanded to see and speak with Miss Clergy.
If some one had meekly sent in a note, it would have
been called presumption itself. But to demand to speak
with Miss Clergy and to gain one’s point as well was
nothing short of marvellous!</p>

<p>For Thurley had been admitted and had rushed up
the winding stairs like the “younger generation who
come knocking at the door.” She had entered the mysterious
front room and remained there, while Hopeful
and Ali Baba remained below in a state of fearful curiosity.</p>

<p>Whatever the conversation was it was of interest to
Miss Clergy. An hour later Miss Clergy saw her guest
to the door and then called Hopeful and said that she
was taking Thurley Precore to New York by the morning
train. She wished to have a trunk—this with a
slight quaver in her voice—packed with the best of
what she had; she would buy a new wardrobe as soon
as she reached the city. She wished no questions asked
nor did she wish Hopeful to answer any questions until
they had boarded the train. Hopeful was to have her
cousin Betsey Pilrig come to live at the Fincherie, because
Thurley Precore wished to have her provided for—her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
voice softened at Thurley’s name—and they were
liable to be away for a long time.</p>

<p>Gasping, twisting her apron, dizzy with trying to comprehend
new order of things, Hopeful had insisted,
“But what am I to say after—after you have boarded
the train?”</p>

<p>“Say Miss Clergy has taken Thurley Precore to New
York to have her study for grand opera,” Miss Clergy
said, after a moment’s deliberation. “And the engagement
with Dan Birge is broken for all time.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile, at Betsey Pilrig’s house, Thurley was
kneeling before the gentle old lady and telling in her
rapt, dramatic fashion,</p>

<p>“I’m going, Granny. I found out all in a moment
that I didn’t love Dan as I should. Of course it hurts
a little, but they say it is good to have a love affair
terminating badly, if you’re to sing in opera. Anyway,
I’m going. You are to stay at the Fincherie and be
taken care of forever and ever, and, as soon as I’m
famous, I’ll pay Miss Clergy back for all her kindness
and we’ll have a lovely, white house, you and I, where
I’ll come for vacations. It’s so different from singing
in church, isn’t it?” She laughed the innocent laugh of
pure joy. “Oh, I’m not afraid I’ll not make good.
Something tells me I shall—the same as the day I told
Philena that cripples could be conquerors—remember?
And, Granny, it is really better for Dan, and, if he comes
here to-night to see me, say I’ve gone to bed and I’m too
tired to be called ... no, no, I’m sure of myself!
Granny dear, don’t let the old box-car fall to pieces, I
want it as a souvenir. When I build my beautiful house,
it shall stay close beside it. It was my home, you
know!” The scarlet lips quivered for an instant.</p>

<p>“But are you happy, Thurley, giving up a good man’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
love, going with that woman to New York?” The gentle,
narrow mind could not comprehend this whirlwind
of events, strange and astonishing.</p>

<p>“I’m happier than I’ve been in years! There must
be gypsy in me. I’m happy at the thought of travelling
again! The old days, even the hungry, cold ones in
the box-car wagon, were happier than the days of being
fed and warmed but made to sit in school and sew my
stint afternoons. Don’t you see, Granny dear, I’m different;
and when a person finds that out for sure and
some wonderful thing happens to them like Miss Clergy’s
hearing me sing that it’s the right thing to go on and
follow the trail? Tell Dan—no, I’ll write him, bless
his old heart, he didn’t know I halfway wanted to refuse
to marry him,” Thurley sobered as if momentarily
contrite.</p>

<p>Betsey Pilrig looked at her with lack of comprehension.
“Maybe you’re right—maybe you’re wrong.
I’ve no power to keep you. What did she say when she
offered to take you away?”</p>

<p>“So many things! I could travel abroad, and, if
I worked very hard and the right person trained me,
she thought I would be famous and she is to be my godmother
as it were. The only condition was not to marry
for twenty years—that was easy to promise. For I’ll
never love any one but Dan, and all of me didn’t love
him. So I gave my pledge. She would not have taken
me unless I did. She’s bitter, Granny, because of her
own affair. She likes to think of cheating a man of me—poor
dear! Why, I didn’t mind the promising.”</p>

<p>“I don’t like the condition,” Betsey said, gravely.
“You’re young and you don’t know all that is in your
heart any more than the world knows of your voice.
That wasn’t fair of her!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>But Thurley in a state of ecstasy refused to listen.
She fell to packing, and, when Dan came an hour later,
Betsey was forced to send him away with the unsatisfactory
message that Thurley was busy—she would see
him later.</p>

<p>After which Betsey Pilrig watched the light of his
roadster twinkle into nothingness. Moonlight called her
attention to the box-car wagon. She visualized the
long-legged, ragged child Thurley who had sung for
her supper—and got it—at the Hotel Button, and
the worthless parents. Then she saw Philena limping
eagerly about in Thurley’s train as they played missionaries;
she saw Thurley in her white dress on Children’s
Day when she was made to speak the part of Saturday
and declared joyously that she did not care, she
really wanted to work for her living. She saw a taller,
lovelier Thurley singing at Philena’s funeral. Then she
saw Dan and Thurley in the first flush of courtship, with
Thurley all blushes and happy songs and four or five
engagements a day, while Dan’s business ran itself ...
well, that was at an end. In her simple fashion Betsey
realized the girl Thurley would never return nor would
Dan Birge remain a light-hearted, whistling boy. As
for Abby Clergy, some folks might call it generous on
her part to take Thurley to the city, but Betsey called it
using youth as a crutch and a revenge and she wondered
what Miss Abby’s parents would have said if they had
known.</p>

<p>“It’s late, Granny love! Tell me—did he mind?”
Turning, she found Thurley waiting to say good night
to her.</p>

<p>She came and peeked over Betsey’s shoulder at the
old wagon. “Good-by, funny home,” she kissed her
finger tips to it. “I sha’n’t forget you—not even if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
I drive into the Corners the next time in a limousine with
a footman.”</p>

<p class="tb">After Miss Clergy and Thurley had left the Corners,
Hopeful and Ali Baba took the day off to get out an extra
of their own as to what had happened.</p>

<p>“ ... dressed in a black silk forty-year old she was
and a hat to match and all her rings on her fingers and
the same hobnail boots,” Ali Baba informed Corners
loungers, “but as chirp as if she’d never gone to ruin for
over thirty years about an Eyetalian barber—poor Miss
Abby! And I bet my hat, she’ll have new clothes and
be as up to snuff as they make ’em when she gets to New
York.... Thurley? Oh, her own self with a pink
dress and a white shade hat and Miss Abby sayin’ to her,
‘We’ll only be shabby a little while longer. It isn’t
goin’ to take us long to learn new ways.’ Thurley’s
eyes was as blue as the sea and she kept starin’ out beyond
everybody and goodness only knows what she was
thinkin’ ... anyhow, they’re gone! We’ve orders to
close the house and blest if she didn’t have our cousin Betsey
Pilrig come to live with us—as good a thing as Miss
Abby has done in over thirty years—for it will take the
heart from Betsey to lose Thurley, too! When Dan
Birge knows that Abby Clergy has stole his girl and she
isn’t goin’ to marry him no more’n a terrier’ll leave a
badger hole, I guess for the first time in history a Birge
will be so sore he’ll have to ride in a rubber-tired cab!”
Conscious of being the courier of a thrilling event, Ali
Baba nonchalantly borrowed tobacco and strolled on to
spread the glad tidings.</p>

<p>Even a mystery or a haunted lady becomes a bore
after a certain time. It is like a jolly week-end guest
who, without invitation, spends the entire season in one’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
only and best pink room. So had Miss Clergy become
a nonentity to the town—“a pity,” the older people
said, “a pill” retorted the younger.</p>

<p>Which explained somewhat the shock it gave the town
when news of her flight to New York with Thurley was
announced. “How could that poor soul ever get up
and get?” the town asked itself. The truth of the
rapidity was that because she had been dormant for so
many years—and had endless money—any activity
would either be of microscopic importance or stupendous
haste; there could be no middle, sane course of action.
With Thurley Precore as the incentive, the former course
was out of the question. It was like the sleeping princess
upon rousing—she lost no time in finding out the state
of mind towards him who kissed and wakened her. So
Miss Clergy could not leave town fast enough to please
herself. She trembled lest Dan Birge, through customary
masculine knavery, trick Thurley into marriage and cheat
her newly-throbbing heart of its long-awaited revenge.</p>

<p>Three weeks later, when the town was still agog, saying
they guessed even “the crabs were laughing with
their claws” at the thought of a Birge being handed the
mitten, two pillars of the church vowed that Dan Birge
had proposed to Lorraine McDowell and been accepted;
that he had spoken to her father about the wedding. So
he could not have cared so much or else he was marrying
Lorraine out of spite. Lorraine would be, at any
event, mistress of the twenty-thousand-dollar house and
would wear both the solitaire and the wedding band Dan
had planned to give Thurley Precore.</p>

<p>The news rivalled the amazement over Miss Clergy’s
recovery. The town began to “lot” on whether or not
Thurley, with all her notions of being a fine singer, would
not be sorry some day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>“He should have married Thurley to meet his equal,”
Ali Baba declared. “’Raine has as much chance with
him as a paper-shell almond against a hickory nut! Yes,
we got a letter from Thurley—she said they was well—that
was about all!”</p>

<p class="tb">But the town never knew quite all about Dan’s sudden
engagement to Lorraine nor Lorraine’s acceptance of
Thurley’s suitor. They never knew that Dan, white-faced
and with a strange, red light in his eyes, had
come to Lorraine to plead with her that she marry
him.</p>

<p>To Dan’s despairing anger of youth, Lorraine yielded
because of her own despairing love. “I know you love
Thurley,” she said, when he scarcely embraced her.
“You want to show her some one loves you enough to
marry you ... and you knew I always cared. Dan,
will you learn to care afterwards? I’ll be the best wife I
can! I’ll do everything you want me to do!” She wondered
why he winced at the words.</p>

<p>He was thinking of Thurley’s wild rose, defiant, adorable
self. It had all happened so quickly that he wondered
if it were not some hideous, unfair nightmare from
which he would soon waken—and meet Thurley!</p>

<p>But as he looked at her gentle face he knew it was
reality; that for over three weeks Thurley had been
away from the Corners, Abigail Clergy’s fortune at her
disposal to prove that she could sing and the whole world
would listen.</p>

<p>Only that hastily scribbled note was left him—he
wondered some days when he was trying to attend to
business and not act conscious of the glances of his clerks
and customers, whether he might not burst out saying
the words,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">Dan—</p>

<p>Miss Clergy has promised to take me to New York and let me
study. I was telling you the truth about it. I know it is for the
best, we could never make each other happy—forgive and forget,</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Thurley.</span></p>

</div>

<p>“Well—I always liked you, ’Raine,” he forced himself
into saying. “And it’s mighty sensible—I guess
your father will say yes.”</p>

<p>“He may think a marriage for—spite,” she added
half inaudibly, “isn’t right, but I’ll marry you anyway,
Dan,” this to his surprise.</p>

<p>“It hurts to love so hard, doesn’t it?” he asked impersonally.
“I thought she was only joking about the
fair—but I guess if she knows her own mind, I can
know mine!” Determination to turn the tables on
Thurley and the town surged to the front. “It’s nobody’s
business whether I marry you to-morrow—I’m
going right on with the plans for the house and the ring—and
all of it! I guess we can learn to be happy in
our own way,” he touched her hair gently. “You’re
an awful good little girl to care enough not to be jealous
of Thurley. I don’t think you’ll ever be sorry we
married ... sometimes it takes a funny sort of thing—like
my being engaged to Thurley, you know,” he stumbled
over the situation in poorly chosen words, “and
her wanting a career and leaving me, to make other people
happy!” He tried to laugh, lovable, broken-hearted
boy, and Lorraine tried to laugh, too, lovable girl whose
broken heart was beginning to mend. “And here I am
marrying the same little girl I played with—so here’s
our pledge to be happy—no matter what.”</p>

<p>To Lorraine’s father, who questioned the sudden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
courtship, he said with Birge aggression, “Lorraine loves
me and she’ll never marry any other fellow. I guess you
know all there is to my being engaged to Thurley, sir.
I’m sorry it ever got into the paper, but that’s done and
there is no taking it back. I loved Thurley, but I’d
be a fool to mope my life away like Miss Clergy did because
a girl wanted to sing instead of be my wife. After
all, it’s not a matter of life and death.” He wondered
if the Reverend McDowell knew how loud his heart was
thumping, great irregular thumps, each one trying to say
in its dumb fashion, “Oh, Thurley-<em>dear</em>!” But he finished
bravely, “I’m making plans to build and I guess
you know I’ll take good care of ’Raine. If you’ve any
other objection to me, I’d like to hear it.”</p>

<p>“Nothing but the haste, my lad,” the older man said
slowly. “My child would never marry another man—but
yourself—this ‘heart on the rebound’—”</p>

<p>“I want ’Raine!” Dan cried, striking the chair arm
with the flat of his palm. “And I’m going to marry her.
I’ll wait until the house is built, if you think it best, but
she’s promised to marry me and she won’t change.”</p>

<p>“Then why bother me at all?” Lorraine’s father
could not refrain from saying. “It was never a Birge
habit, as I recall it.”</p>

<p>After Dan left the parsonage study to tell Lorraine
her father approved, but they would wait until Fairview
was ready for occupancy, and diligently measured her
ring finger, finding it two sizes smaller than Thurley’s,
he left her, dazed with joy yet trying to still the something
which whispered,</p>

<p>“He loves Thurley; you must always be content with
crumbs.”</p>

<p>Lorraine began counting over the things in the long-closed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
hope chest and planning to crowd it to overflowing.
What mattered it, if they were not married for a
year or two? Was she not “bespoken” to Dan Birge?
And Lorraine was quite positive she would not change
her mind.</p>

<p>Upon leaving Lorraine that day, Dan went to the box-car
wagon to sit for a long time on its steps, thinking the
bitter, rebellious things of youth, that dangerous noon-time,
trying to forget the glorious moment when he had
measured Thurley’s ring finger with a blade of grass
she had plucked near Philena’s grave, how every bit of
him thrilled with a new, savage joy and new, savage
longings ... well, it was to be Lorraine! He flipped
the bit of ribbon she had used as a ring guide on the end
of his thumb in disdain. After all, it must hurt Thurley
a very little when she should hear the news, and, like
most of the world, when they cannot have their way unhampered,
to hurt the object of past adoration is quite
the natural procedure!</p>

<p>When Birge’s Corners exhibited customary signs of
fall, with winter clothes hung out to be beaten, smells of
catsup and corn relish, the broken panes in the opera house
windows repaired and the poster of a gaudy burlesque
queen pasted on the billboard, a full line of mufflers and
overcoats crowding the emporium show cases, bonfires of
leaves and misty haze veiling the early mornings, Thurley
Precore and Abby Clergy, two islands of old-fashionedness,
entirely surrounded by seas of new fashion,
safely ensconced in a comfortable hotel suite, were chatting
like schoolgirls over the momentous event of the
morrow.</p>

<p>For Thurley was to meet the Napoleon of grand opera,
the master critic and coach, who could make or mar
the most talented person in creation—Bliss Hobart, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
mysterious, powerful, never-erring judge of one’s abilities,
both latent and developed.</p>

<p>Miss Clergy’s solicitors and Miss Clergy’s checkbook
skilfully deciphered false lures of singing teachers and
alleged powerful agents, and had, at the same time, discovered
the nucleus of the New York art world. So
Thurley was to make her bow, as it were, to the very
public itself at noon to-morrow.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<p>Bliss Hobart was impossible to describe, Thurley concluded.
As she first spied him behind his carved teakwood
desk, one of a hundred luxuries in his elaborate
studio, he appeared a small, insignificant person with
an overlarge head betraying the aristocracy of an
old race and piercing gray eyes. His hair, a salt and
pepper affair with a wild front-lock waving as signal
for a controversy, showed the result of a fever, not age,
she afterwards learned, and his long, almost grotesque
nose and flexible mouth with its deeply-dimpled chin inspired
her with a desire to laugh. But as he came across
the room to greet Miss Clergy and give Thurley a
cheerful nod, she saw that he was as tall as her own
self and his shoulders were broad and powerful, while
his wonderfully shaped hands championed his abilities.
He was dressed more foppishly than she had ever
seen a man dress—a blue serge with a corded white
waistcoat, an exquisite sapphire pin in the cream satin
scarf and a watch chain as slender as a woman’s. As
he whisked out his handkerchief characteristically, she
discovered it to be of more cobwebby texture than her
own.</p>

<p>Facing him, her blue eyes staring in naïve wonderment,
Thurley asked herself why she had experienced the illusion
of this man’s being a clever dwarf with cruel, calculating
eyes! Whatever Bliss Hobart thought of Thurley
would have been impossible to state. He seemed more
interested in Miss Clergy whose thin face was flushed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
with excitement and whose small self wore a sheathlike
dress of black silk, which suited her well.</p>

<p>For the moment Bliss Hobart seemed a respectful
footman solicitous about his mistress’ comfort, as he
“fussed” over selecting a chair for Miss Clergy and
asked as to draughts. Thurley was left in confusion in
the middle of the great room, looking out at Central
Park.</p>

<p>She tried to steady her thoughts by taking inventory of
the room’s contents, but it added to her bewilderment.
There was something of every period in furnishings—shrug-shouldered
French, the burly Jacobean, the Victorian
redolent of posies, curls and lace mitts, subtle Oriental
and convenient Mission—there was rare glass which had
successfully imprisoned Italian sunshine, Holland delft-ware,
cloisonne, snowy linen panels from China encrusted
with gold dragons, lamps with the magic of India and
great jars of Navajo pottery. Behind the desk was a
door halfway ajar—Thurley caught her breath as she
looked at it. This must be the sacred spot where one
was “tried out.” The agent finally arranging the interview
had told them that when Bliss Hobart was convinced
he had a find, he went into the little anteroom and played
accompaniments or scales or whatever he wished, while he
tested voices. But before he heard one sing, he had a
way of deciding whether or not it was worth while to pass
through the anteroom door.</p>

<p>Thurley wondered if she could make any sound at
all—her voice seemed frozen. Supposing she did not
meet Miss Clergy’s expectations? Supposing she were
forced to return to Birge’s Corners or to stay in
New York as a ribbon clerk, sharing another ribbon
clerk’s hall bedroom? She began looking at the collection
of autographed photographs which lined the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
walls, the marble statues, the bas reliefs, some paintings
of an interesting, delicate sort in pastels and
shadowy outlines which hung close beside the teakwood
desk. Then the portrait of a striking, but not beautiful,
woman claimed Thurley’s attention. The woman
had a clever, quick face with flashing black eyes, almost as
black as Dan’s, and blue-black hair, quite like Dan’s,
combed into a huge knot at the nape of her thin, yet
attractive, neck. She were a Grecian frock—two layers
of white voile and a layer of black with a jet cord for a
girdle. It was a merciless frock, Thurley decided, for it
showed the woman’s bony, frail figure and unlovely, long
arms with wonderfully <em>live</em> hands and surprisingly stubby
fingers. On the third finger of each hand was an antique
ring, the glow of the jewels shining on the white
lap of her frock. Something about the picture fascinated
Thurley. She was wondering if this woman were not
Bliss Hobart’s wife; if she did not find it a stupendous
task to be as clever and as keen as her husband. Yet
those well-modeled scarlet lips and the rather masculine
chin told Thurley that the woman was equal to almost
any task. By contrast, glancing in a side mirror, Thurley
felt herself overdone and impossible. She longed to
exit silently and drop down the nearest elevator shaft in
peaceful oblivion.</p>

<p>Before she had reached the studio she had felt sure of
herself, scornful of criticism. Miss Clergy told her she
looked a picture in her frock of white crêpe, embroidered
with dull red, and a smart crimson sailor to match. But
as she pulled off her gloves in nervousness she felt unfit,
impossible, one mammoth gaucherie—her wilful brown
hair would creep out in untidy strands and her face grow
flushed in spite of the conventional coating of powder.
She wondered what Dan Birge would say if he came into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
the studio of the “wisest and most cynical man in New
York’s art world” and saw her!</p>

<p>“Ah,” Hobart was saying, “we can go inside now—”</p>

<p>Thurley started. Miss Clergy was sitting in blissful
rapture in an easy chair by the window, her gray head
nodding at Thurley in delight.</p>

<p>Thurley wondered how long she had been standing
spellbound. She had thought and felt so many strange
things and emotions that the time she was sure must be
great.</p>

<p>“I won’t keep you out here,” Hobart was saying, just
the suggestion of a blur in his pleasant voice. “Some
one might stray in, and I’ve an appointment for lunch.
Miss Clergy, please help yourself to something to read.”</p>

<p>“I sha’n’t be lonesome,” Miss Clergy answered.
They were a strange pair, this wild-rose girl and the little
ghost-lady who had quickened just in time to make the
wild rose become hothouse variety.</p>

<p>“What were you looking at so intently?” Hobart
paused before they went ahead.</p>

<p>“That picture of your wife,” Thurley answered without
delay.</p>

<p>He laughed. “Dear me, that is a very famous person
who is an intimate friend of mine and a friend of my
other intimate friends. Her name is Ernestine Christian
and she is a pianist. Paderewski thinks no one plays
Beethoven as well as Ernestine—you may meet her some
day. But remember that in New York the portraits of
ladies hanging nearest gentlemen’s desks are never likely
to be their wives. Tell me, what do you think of the
painting?”</p>

<p>“That it was by the same artist who did those.”
Thurley pointed childishly.</p>

<p>“Right—Collin Hedley—you’ve heard of him?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>She shook her head. “We live at Birge’s Corners,”
she said demurely.</p>

<p>“Then you will hear of him, particularly if you meet
Miss Christian. Collin painted her portrait as a revenge,
because she insisted that men with Van Dyke
beards always have a queer sense of humor. I take it
you understand who boasts of a Van Dyke beard. Then
they gave me the picture because I am so fond of them
both.” He was leading the way across the room.</p>

<p>As she stepped inside the anteroom, Hobart closed the
door. Looking about she saw tawny, rough plaster
walls, highly polished floors, a white marble mantel seemingly
unconscious of the fire of birch logs ready to be
kindled. Gold-colored curtains shut out daylight; peasant
chairs with rush seats and a great, dark-wooded
settle piled with cushions gave the proper background for
the piano which stood in the center of the room.</p>

<p>“Sit down,” Hobart said pleasantly. “I was so interested
in your fairy godmother that I have not had a good
look at you. There—so—I can see your eyes. How
old are you?” His voice changed to that of an impersonal
and rather impatient stranger’s.</p>

<p>“A little past twenty. Does it matter how old a person
is?”</p>

<p>“Find that out for yourself! Sometimes—sometimes
not. Now tell me, where were you born and educated
and are you engaged to half a dozen lads in Birge’s
Backyard or wherever it is? And why do you want to be
an opera singer, and what has led you to fancy you could
be? Is it because Miss Clergy has advanced you money?
Before you answer, let me add that money does not keep
you in grand opera or any other art work. I’m not saying
that occasionally it does not get you in, although not
as often as envious laymen like to imagine. But it cannot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
keep you on the stage or in the hearts of the people
unless you merit the so doing. You must use your brain,
as well as sing. You may have the voice of angels and
yet fail on the operatic or dramatic stage. You may
have the angelic voice and heavenly beauty and celestial
gowns—and still be registered as zero, unless you use
your brain. You must employ intellect, wit, sincerity,
industry, the same as if you were building a house or
cooking a meal or raising a family. A mediocre singer
with brains can always surpass naturally endowed, but
mentally sluggish, singers. Remember that!” He
leaned back in his chair and his gray eyes narrowed somewhat;
the dimples in his chin vanished and with them the
good-natured, kindly expression.</p>

<p>As if she were pleading with a judge, Thurley, who all
in an instant swept from her savage little self everything
she had fancied she believed, found herself beginning with
admirable logic,</p>

<p>“I was born in Thurley, Idaho, so they named me
Thurley. Just think—if I hadn’t been born until the
next day, it would have been Hoskins, Idaho! So far
luck was with me!”</p>

<p>Half an hour later she ended with, “I shall never go
back to the Corners, and I shall pay Miss Clergy for all
she is doing, no matter if she has no need of the money.
And I shall never marry any one! You see that was my
one promise to Miss Clergy. At least not for twenty
years, she said, because by that time she would be dead
and could haunt me if I went to behaving foolishly.”</p>

<p>Hobart smiled at her as genially as he had smiled at
Miss Clergy, remarking, “Ah, the <i lang="fr">de luxe</i> Topsy, I take
it! I much prefer a Topsy prospect to a Little Eva prospect
with a myriad of interested relations who feel certain
I cannot comprehend the wonderful way their Little Eva<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
sings ‘Madame Butterfly,’ proving it with clippings from
the music column of the Standing Stone <cite>Gazette</cite>! After
all, no one is really interested in <em>you</em>. I take it Miss
Clergy is keen on seeing you cheat a man of love; isn’t
that it?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” loneliness swept over Thurley for the instant,
“I don’t suppose any one really cares about me, because
the people who did care I ran away and left.” She
caught her underlip quickly.</p>

<p>“Then the decks are cleared for action,” Hobart said
with relief. “Before you sing to-day, let me add that
the greatest lesson to learn in order to be a genius, no
matter in what capacity, is to be impersonal. Talent is
<em>personal</em>. That is why you have so excellent a foundation.”</p>

<p>“Always impersonal?”</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders, impatient of the interruption.
“We can’t tell when I haven’t even heard you
sing. My dear child, were I to map out destinies for
every one who comes to me, I should be quite mad. As it
is, to be the ‘final judgment’ takes the disposition of a
dove and the constitution of a lion. You’ll see what I
mean later on. You have had so little education in one
way that it will be hard for you to catch up. You’ll have
to work without ceasing. But you don’t look like a
shirker.”</p>

<p>“I’m not,” she said, hating herself for the flat remark.</p>

<p>“There are two kinds of persons in this world,” he
mused, rising and going over to the piano, “those who
wait for a dead man’s shoes and those keen enough to employ
their own bootmaker. I never hear any one sing
unless I judge them to be of the last class and so,” sitting
down and magically running his fingers over the keys,
“tell me—what can you sing?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>“I love the rôle of <i>Marguerite</i>,” she began innocently.</p>

<p>He paused to chuckle. “Bravo! There never was a
really normal soprano who did not aspire to <i>Marguerite</i>
for her début. It is as much a soprano symptom, as
it is a tenor symptom to yearn to do sacred arias on Easter
Sunday and a basso to growl to be heard at open air
music festivals. The only rhythmic thing about contraltos
is their delight in having cigars named after them.”
He looked up to see if she was laughing at his nonsense.</p>

<p>“But why?” she demanded seriously.</p>

<p>“Well, why are brides fond of trying scalloped potatoes
in new silver pudding dishes? Why do young widows
join bridge clubs or why does a boy cherish his first
teeth to trade in at school for king-chestnuts?” He
picked out a flippant little chord as punctuation.</p>

<p>“You must not call me too stupid,” Thurley said unexpectedly,
leaning her arms on the piano, “but my original
sense of humor—the one I was born with—had to be
put in cold storage when I settled down at Birge’s Corners
and began to borrow the minister’s library in sections.
They just could not have understood it. But I
do believe it is reviving.”</p>

<p>“A sense of humor is the most precious thing in the
world,” Hobart told her. “It ranks with a sense of
honor. And if you had to repress it, I am glad you
merely put it in cold storage. Sing this scale, please,”
he added, rapidly striking the notes.</p>

<p>Thurley sang it; then another and some exercises which
she thought difficult and felt proud of having done so
easily. They were exercises the city organist had halfway
taught her and which she had practised diligently by
means of Betsey Pilrig’s parlor organ.</p>

<p>“Some more—lightly, quickly—no, no, you’re hissing—try<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
mi—mi-mi—so.” Again she followed the
notes cleverly—so she thought.</p>

<p>Hobart interrupted with a discord. “You naturally
breathe well, but you are frightened. You are not singing
but faking, and trying to make me think you are not.
My dear young person, if I were not able to tell in half a
second who is really singing and who is not, I would be
forced to abdicate instanter. Now either go home and
rest up and take off that company manner and then come
back here and sing or admit you cannot sing or else—sing!”
He rested his hands on the keys again.</p>

<p>“I can sing,” Thurley said almost sullenly. “I gave
up marrying the man I love in order to sing.”</p>

<p>“Good plot! I’ll tell it to Caleb Patmore, the novelist,
but my line is not writing. Because you have done
this so-called heroic feat, do not fancy you can become a
grand opera singer as a reward, any more than the schoolgirl’s
fancy is true that nuns are broken-hearted young
women taking poetic refuge in the veil. You are so
young and fearless that you remind me of a nice, willing
but as yet impossible puppy dog who needs to be shown his
place in life. You do not understand that if you have
been given a voice and the will and brains to train it and
the soul of a true artist to preside over all,” his voice was
earnest, “what a gigantic task you are taking upon yourself.
No one has said it better than Tolstoy and Aylmer
Maude. The former tells us, ‘The task of art is enormous,
art should cause violence to be set aside ... art is
not a pleasure, a solace nor an amusement, it is a great
matter, art is an organ of human life transmitting man’s
reasonable perceptions into feeling.’ And Maude has,
to my mind, finished the situation by saying that ‘the one
great quality which makes a work of art truly contagious
is its sincerity.’ <i lang="fr">Voila!</i>” he began strumming bass notes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>“I must write those things down,” Thurley whispered.
“I must learn them—”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“They’re so—so—what is it? Help me out! Remember
I’m from Birge’s Corners, I’ve such lots of things
to learn and I’m really quite afraid of you!” She leaned
nearer him. “I’ll have to study languages and history
and no end of stuff and have hours a day of music and
love no one and be impersonal, until I am able to have
the same <em>look</em> that Ernestine Christian has—she has
learned to be impersonal! I want to cease to be a country
girl with a good voice and be an individual. Please,
Mr. Hobart, let me sing <i>Marguerite</i> for you! I’m not
half so afraid of that as I am of scales—”</p>

<p>He began the music, and, looking away from him at the
rough, plaster walls, Thurley peopled them with a sea of
faces, as she had done hundreds of times in Betsey Pilrig’s
parlor or at the little cemetery while she was waiting for
Dan. She wondered if Miss Clergy heard her sing and if
there would come a chilling burst of criticism from this
man. She felt that, if this were so, she would turn on
him in unexplainable defense of her voice, ignorant as she
was of the things still to be achieved.</p>

<p>Hobart rose from the piano and came to put his firm
hands on her shoulders. “Genius has as many symptoms
as measles,” he said abruptly. “I’m afraid you’ve
every last one of them!”</p>

<p>“You mean,” she said, tense as an unsprung trap,
“that it is going to be worth while?” Things were
black and queerly shaped to her eyes, due to annoying
tears. She thought Hobart’s face a dozen cynical, smiling
faces peeping at her from all sides. “Is it worth
while, if I work very, very hard?”</p>

<p>“Thurley (almost Hoskins) Precore,” it was as if he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
pronounced a decree, “for us to stand here and exchange
the compliments and promises and superlative statements
we are both thinking would be as annoying as women
haggling over which shall pay the cabfare! We could
drag all manner of red herring over the course and merely
waste smart sentences which are in demand for after-dinner
speeches. But if you work as I tell you and do
not become personal either in your relationship with me
or your other musical associates—it isn’t as hard-hearted
as it sounds—and if this presuming young rustic from
Birge’s Backyard stays in the offing—well—you’ll make
your début in about a year!”</p>

<p>Thurley did not answer.</p>

<p>“If you are going to faint,” he continued nonchalantly,
“the settle is well-cushioned and handy. I had to have
one put in here, for they would go down in absurd little
lumps all about the room—sometimes with joy, more
often rage! I see you are not going to faint, so please
sing something else—something to show up the bad
spots. <i>Marguerite</i> is rather full of deceptive curlycues—ah,
I know—hymns—yes, real old-time gospel
hymns! Then we’ll do more exercises, because fright
has taken wings.”</p>

<p>He played half a dozen hymns, all of which she sang
without hesitation, laughing down at him between
stanzas. She could not understand her attitude towards
this baffling, fearsome person, young-old or old-young
whichever he might prove to be. She found herself wondering
if she would ever meet Ernestine Christian and
Collin Hedley and Caleb Patmore, or if being impersonal
was to exclude them as well as Hobart....</p>

<p>“Good, good,” he said, turning from the piano and
hugging up his knees. “Well, we’ll have to get to work
as fast as ever we can. I believe in ‘muscular art,’ the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
same as some one else has said of ‘muscular Christianity’—a
sound mind in a sound body is the best foundation
for lasting success. Success is the sincerity with which
you do your work and the good your work does some one
else—remember that when ennui bursts in an unwelcomed
guest and you begin to ape some of the near-great
who hover about. Art is the expression of a man’s joy
in his work and you’ve everything about and in you, as
well as before you, to prove to the world the truth of
that saying. Many new and confusing things will happen
shortly. All sorts and conditions of people, attentions,
praise, blame, drudgery, ease, dissipations, monotonous
routine—heavens, child, it makes my head ache to
think of an absolutely <i lang="fr">de luxe</i> Topsy from Birge’s Backyard
with the voice of an announcing angel set down in
New York and told to prepare herself for grand opera!”</p>

<p>He patted her on the shoulder. “Don’t look startled,
Thurley—I’ll have to call you Thurley because Precore
sticks in my throat—you’ll weather through and some
time—I’ll tell you a pet scheme of mine that perhaps—”
He actually was confused as if he regretted
the remark. “But for now, I’ll start you off with having
you report here every day at eleven and again at
three—and you’re to do all the other things I tell you.
Well, did you think I would order you to Italy first to get
mellow, fall in love with one of those damned Italian
officers with a heliotrope-lined coat and then come back
and let me teach you to sing? God taught you to sing
before you came to earth, and you’ve remembered His
teaching.... Just learn the things we men are fools
enough to think we must know and you have won!”</p>

<p>He closed the pianoforte and opened the door.</p>

<p>“No more exercises?” Thurley was tingling with
excitement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>“You’re all nerves! Do you think I need more exercises
to make me quite sure about you—the same as an
apron never fails to convince a man of the wearer’s domesticity?
To-morrow we begin to polish and prune.
Go home and lie down and think about the frivolous
things in the world. You’ll be set to work fast enough
... ah, Miss Clergy, and did you hear us?”</p>

<p>“I heard Thurley sing,” Miss Clergy said abruptly.
“Well—well?”</p>

<p>Thurley answered by stooping down and clasping the
ghost lady in her arms. “He says it is worth your
while,” she whispered.</p>

<p>“Then it has been worth everything,” Miss Clergy
answered, more to herself than to Thurley.</p>

<p>Hobart’s secretary came in with some announcement
cards and Hobart paused before he read them to say
good-by.</p>

<p>“To-morrow at eleven, and Baxter will see you this
afternoon about other teachers. Good-by, Miss Clergy,
and, Thurley, happy days!”</p>

<p>He was so kindly again and with the suggestion of a
schoolboy pal that Thurley could not resist the asking,
“Oh, do you find many people worth all your trouble?”</p>

<p>Hobart’s eyes crinkled with amusement. “To quote a
most reliable authority, the pushcart man, ‘What I maka
on the peanut, I losa on the banan!’”</p>

<p>As they passed out the door, Thurley heard a woman’s
voice saying, “Tell him Lissa Dagmar has come to say
good-by. He won’t keep me waiting. I’m sailing this
afternoon.” There was both a snarl and a purr in the
voice, and Thurley wondered if Lissa Dagmar had
proved “peanut or banan.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>

<p>If Miss Clergy and Thurley were mysteries to the hotel
guests and attendants, so were the guests and attendants
mysteries untold to Thurley and Miss Clergy. To be
placed suddenly in New York with unlimited leeway in
opportunities and money, cut off from every simple, human
tie which heretofore had impressed itself on one’s
emotional heart and be put to work at such a multitude of
things that one could hardly remember which hour was
designated for this and which for that—to say the very
least, it was “tizzy,” as Hobart obligingly expressed it
for Thurley during one of their lessons.</p>

<p>No less “tizzy” was it for Miss Clergy to waken from
a selfish lethargy, with revenge the stimulating impulse;
to try, all in an instant, to find her way back to the proper
method of living combined with modern requirements and
readjustments; to become accustomed to strange noises,
vehicles, buildings, all manner of new and bewildering
novelties which every one else, save her wild-rose Thurley,
accepted as commonplace; to refrain from telling
every one who talked with her the reason she had taken
this homeless country girl to New York and was prepared
to spend a fortune to make her a success.</p>

<p>The modistes and milliners used to gossip about it,
after they had been in Miss Clergy’s rooms to take measurements
and orders. So did the bootmaker Hobart had
sent up, and the riding master and the language teacher
and the social secretary, who somehow slipped into her
place and became one of them. A veritable monument<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
to fashion and smartness she was, with the way of making
one sit up straight when one was least expecting the command,
of smoothing out personal pronouns to the ease of
every one concerned, who found time every day to make
Thurley practise entering and leaving a room, bowing,
shaking hands, smiling, laughing, holding her head just
so, who had stacks of hateful cards and sheets of paper
on which Thurley must write invitations to imaginary
dinners and affairs and then reply to the invitations, who
told one that the easiest way to carry on a conversation
was to be an excellent listener, and yet, all in the same
breath, made one memorize certain smart phrases or witty
bon mots, historical dates of importance, soothing sentences
which would fit in for the weather, a clay pigeon
match or the assassination of the president—all these
things and more did the social secretary achieve, Thurley
groaning inwardly as the hour approached for her arrival.</p>

<p>Yet she stumbled through her lessons without bringing
down too many frowns on her young shoulders, and when
she sat at the improvised dinner table with a startling
array of crystal glasses, goblets and small silver, and was
requested to demonstrate the use of each, the social secretary
nodded approval in a short time and said one day
in that well-bred, monotonous voice,</p>

<p>“You’re so shockingly bright, Miss Precore, I’m sure
there’s a scandal in the family somewhere,” laughing
outright at Thurley’s embarrassment.</p>

<p>“Have you really had people more stupid than I?”
she demanded.</p>

<p>“Dear, yes! My last two pupils were twins, Golda
and Silva Muggins from New Mexico. It would take a
regiment to count their fortunes—but their manners!”
She shrugged her trim shoulders. “And yet they both<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
are engaged and doing nicely—I’m to finish buying the
trousseaux to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“What frightful work to teach—” Thurley began.
At which the social secretary fled lest Thurley entangle
her in a really human vein of conversation and endanger
her poise.</p>

<p>Following these lessons Miss Clergy would have Thurley
come into her room and have her repeat all she had
learned, after which Thurley would manage to escape to
her own bedroom to burst into rebellious, beautiful song.
For singing at the present time seemed to be of the least
importance of all the things she did!</p>

<p>A gymnast came each morning before breakfast and
made her exercise and do folk dances, all manner of antics
strange and, to her mind, ludicrous. There was a beauty
doctor who did her nails and took charge of her hair and
skin, showing her which colors were becoming and which
were not and the test for any woman in doubt as to the
proper shade to wear—to lay a strip of the proposed
goods across the hair, not the throat or cheek, as women
fondly delude themselves—and see if the light and effect
are to be desired.</p>

<p>“How many teachers does one great big girl need,
Aunt Abby?” Thurley said, six weeks after Hobart had
told her the little story of the peanut and the banana.
“How do they think one brain can remember everything?
How do you know Mr. Hobart isn’t going to be disappointed
after all? He has never said a word about my
voice since that first day, just scales and horrid nasal
exercises and that grimy little Bohemian man to take me
in tow half the time.... I’m dead tired, that’s the
truth—” She flung herself down in characteristic fashion
beside Miss Clergy. She wanted some one to ruffle
up her hair affectionately or whisper there would be a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
chestnut party that afternoon near Wood’s Hollow.
And here the memory of Dan Birge would steal in, an
unwelcome yet paramount personage, so she jumped up
and ran over to the window.</p>

<p>“You can’t disappoint me,” Miss Clergy protested.
“Mr. Hobart has said you wouldn’t.”</p>

<p>“Really?” Her face flushed. “Why, he’s never
mentioned it—”</p>

<p>“It’s a secret,” Miss Clergy added childishly.
“Don’t give me away. Most girls have to study for
years and go abroad, but Mr. Hobart wants to prove that
an American trained girl can be as great a prima donna
as one who enters the stage by way of Vienna or Paris.
Come back, Thurley, I want to tell you something.” She
held out her arms as stiltedly as a marionette.</p>

<p>Thurley obeyed.</p>

<p>“I want you to be happy because you will be both rich
and famous. Isn’t that enough?” Her bright eyes
peered into Thurley’s face.</p>

<p>“You mean because I’ll keep my vow to you about not
marrying—and I ought to be satisfied to have the other
things?”</p>

<p>“Maybe so. I’m a queer old woman and I choose to
live the rest of my queer old life as I please. But I saved
you from the terrible, but common fate—marrying a
small-town bully and being a faded drudge. We’ll leave
that for the minister’s daughter.”</p>

<p>“But Dan would never marry Lorraine—why—”
Thurley paused. She was remembering the day Lorraine
had brought her the embroidered set. How very sweet
was Betsey Pilrig’s garden, far sweeter than the imported
scent they had her use! How lovely and peaceful were
the green fields which stretched as far as eye could see
... not tall, dirty buildings with myriads of shaded windows,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
each concealing some human being with woes and
longings greater than her own! How lovely was the old
box-car, the first home the girl had known! She had
worn pink linen that day Lorraine came! She had paid
for it by extra lessons given in South Wales, and Dan had
sent her the sash for a surprise. How simple but how
sane it all had been! She glanced at her blue velvet
frock trimmed with moleskin—“so ultra,” they murmured
when they fitted it. Perhaps this was the better
way.</p>

<p>Miss Clergy caught the drift of her thoughts and the
withered hand closed firmly over Thurley’s. “If he did
marry her, you’d be glad to dance at the wedding,
wouldn’t you?” she insisted.</p>

<p>The actress in Thurley rescued her so that she could
say, “Of course, that’s all left behind. No use being like
a story-book girl unless you have a s-story-book heart.
Now it’s time for Mr. Hobart’s lesson, <i lang="it">mia</i>, so I’m off.
I wish you’d let me walk sometimes or take a subway!
I’m tired of being whirled away in taxis! Why, I
haven’t even had a moment alone at Grant’s Tomb,”
laughing in spite of herself.</p>

<p>Miss Clergy smiled. “I’m so proud of you!” she declared.
“If I had only found you years ago—”</p>

<p>“I tried to find you,” Thurley reminded.</p>

<p>“Ah, but you didn’t sing that day! If you had, everything
would have changed for us both. When you sing,
Thurley, the world is yours—”</p>

<p>Thurley was at the mirror fitting on a high black hat
with a bunch of old-blue plumes. “Do you think any
one would love me, if I could not sing?” she demanded
impetuously.</p>

<p>Miss Clergy became confused. “Dear me, Thurley, I
cannot think of you as separate from your voice. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
would be no Thurley if there were no Thurley voice.”</p>

<p>Thurley trilled a scale or so. She was thinking of a
black-haired lad who had said many’s the time, “Hang
your voice, Thurley! It’s you I love—just you!”
Pink linen and old-fashioned parlor organs did have compensations.</p>

<p>“When you come back, we’ll plan about our real
home,” Miss Clergy added. “My lawyers try to impress
on me what a neglectful person I’ve been. They
want me to mend my ways and spend my money—not be
a sort of Hetty Green always travelling about with a little
satchel of securities!” Miss Clergy’s sense of humor
was reviving with the rest.</p>

<p>“Our real home—besides the Fincherie? You’ll
never give that up?”</p>

<p>Miss Clergy frowned. “Not the Fincherie! I mean
here in New York. We can’t go on living in a hotel. It
is too common, too parvenu. I want the right sort of
home for you, the sort that your ability will deserve.”</p>

<p>Thurley was in the doorway. “I beg you will do nothing
of the sort,” she said. “You have loaded me now
with the treasures of Arabia. I beg you will not! I
want to earn things myself—as I did at the Corners—you
must let me. Being supported takes something out
of me, I don’t know what,” she clasped her hands in her
rapt fashion. “I’d rather live in a tiny room, or a box-car,
you know, and have very skimpy meals and old-style
clothes and study hard and forget the meals and clothes
and then earn the beautiful, lovely things. That would
make me feel right, ’way inside.”</p>

<p>Miss Clergy’s withered face lost some of its haunted
expression. “Well, my dear, you shall wait then and
earn your home, but I am afraid that, if it is quite your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
own home, you will not want to share it with a funny old
per—”</p>

<p>At which Thurley flew across the room and put her
fresh cheek against the faded one to promise with the
enthusiasm of untried youth that the home she should
earn would be but half her home, for the other half would
belong to a certain dear person.</p>

<p>Whirling towards the studio, Thurley drew Betsey Pilrig’s
letter from her bag. It was the second letter she
had had from the Corners, for Betsey Pilrig undertook
writing a letter with the same solemn preparation that
most people give to making a will. It required several
days of deciding “what to say to her” and a battle
against natural inertia before she could sit at the red-covered
dining-table and force her toil-worn fingers to
write in cramped characters unreal-sounding phrases.
Besides, Betsey Pilrig had always sealed letters with the
firm conviction that maybe they would never get there
anyway, letters seemed such queer things to go flying
about the country.</p>

<p>Not that Betsey had not thought of Thurley every
hour in the day, standing in the doorway of her house
and of the Fincherie to picture again the blue-eyed young
goddess dancing imperiously up the walk or sitting under
gnarled apple trees to shell peas or peel potatoes, singing
in glorious tones as she did so.</p>

<p>When Thurley’s letters had come to Betsey, she and
Hopeful read them aloud to Ali Baba and the trio sat discussing
the fate of their songbird. To their minds the
“happening” was still something to be talked of with
suspicion. One does not fancy a “ghost” taking a beloved
child to the city, never to return, and being responsible,
so it had become known, for Dan Birge’s broken
heart and his mad engagement to Lorraine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>“She’ll never come back the same,” Ali Baba would
insist.</p>

<p>“Abby Clergy will leave her every nickel,” Hopeful
would supplement. “Then she’s bound to come back
and lord it over Dan Birge.”</p>

<p>“She’ll be a great singer—God love and keep her,”
was Betsey’s plea.</p>

<p>As Thurley broke the seal on the letter, she felt as if
she wanted to drive to the station willy-nilly to take the
first train to the Corners, to come into the emporium and,
upon seeing Dan, say that she was “sorry” and she still
wanted him to plan for the new house ... but she was
on her way to Bliss Hobart’s studio, envied of the envied,
dressed as a “princess,” with strange wisdom concerning
many things making inroads into her simple heart.</p>

<p>She read the letter hastily:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">Dear Thurley:</p>

<p>I don’t know how to tell you but you ought to know that Dan
and Lorraine are engaged and every one knows Dan don’t care two
straws for Lorraine, poor girl, but she is dead in love with him.
He done it for spite and I guess they will both be sorry. Unless
he leaves town he can’t get out of marrying her because her father
is the minister. He looks haunted like and my heart aches for
him and for her. Dear Thurley, you will not mind, you are in
such a big city with so many things to see and do and all the
lovely clothes you say you have and your teachers and all the rest.
Sometimes it seems a dream to me.</p>

<p>Will you ever come back to us, Thurley, tell me if you go to
church and have they asked you to sing in meeting? How is Miss
Clergy, does she ever talk about that Eyetalian fellow?</p>

<p>We are well and Hopeful and me get along so well in this house
except that it seems pretty big and that it ain’t right to take charity.
Ali Baba misses you, he says he will send a box of apples when
he gets the ones he wants for you. Thank you for the dress and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
coat, they are too fine for my old self. God bless Thurley Precore,</p>

<p>from,</p>

<p class="center">yours respectfully,</p>

<p class="right">B. Pilrig.</p>

</div>

<p>The driver was opening the door for Thurley to leave
the cab. After a moment she handed him a bill, threading
her way through the crowd until she reached the
studio building. She wondered if Hobart would notice
her manner and comment on it; if she could manage to
get through her lesson without breaking down. Dan and
Lorraine engaged—with her ring—and it would be
Lorraine’s house with the sun parlor that Thurley once
planned and the big living room (right across the front
of the house, Danny boy, and a fireplace big enough for
two Santa Clauses); Lorraine would revel in the garden
pergola and plan the sun dial—oh, it hurt, <em>it hurt</em>—she
was a miserable, jealous coward!</p>

<p>How dared Lorraine take her Dan, pale-faced, scheming
little creature willing to be a doormat for some one
who did not love her! As Thurley entered the elevator,
the thought stimulated her in dangerous fashion....
Even yet, if she were to return to Birge’s Corners and
say to Dan, “I am sorry—love me, darling,” he would
fling discretion and Lorraine to the winds and all would
be as it once had been.... Well, she might do it ... after
she was famous ... it would have twice the sting
and double the triumph.... He would have had time
to regret.... She did not love Dan as dearly as she
loved love itself, he being the ardent agent of the great
force. She wondered if she could love fame as much.
She had a flash of realization of what a broken heart
such as Miss Clergy’s must have been. Miss Clergy had
no talent. Love had been her all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>Hobart was playing a new song as she came into the
room. He did not pause to greet her but said, after a
moment, looking into a mirror over the piano in which
he could see her quite distinctly, “What is wrong? Only
a tight slipper? Take off that ridiculous bonnet and
come here! I want you to try this—” It was such a
jarring contrast, with that wonderful element of sustained
and hidden force which such men as Hobart need
in order to conquer genius, that Thurley felt the past,
of Birge’s Corners and its petty woes and happenings,
fade as if some one had painted it out with a mighty
brush.</p>

<p>She came to stand beside him, while he taught her the
song, making no comment when she finished but turning
to a book of prosaic scales.</p>

<p>“Please answer some questions,” Thurley demanded,
putting her hand on his arm.</p>

<p>“This is lesson time!” He adjusted a pair of reading
glasses critically.</p>

<p>“Let me miss a lesson. I never see you other times
and I’ve the right to ask questions.”</p>

<p>With an amused smile he flipped at the keys. “Shoot
away,” he sighed.</p>

<p>“What do you think of me?” she began promptly.</p>

<p>“I never tell women what I think of them. Please
let’s get to work.”</p>

<p>“Tell me this—am I a real genius?” unconscious of
the implied egotism.</p>

<p>“Of course,” he answered simply. “Would I bother
so much with you if you were not? Would I send a
regiment of teachers and coaches to get you into proper
form? But enough of that! Only don’t let it spoil you.
Still I don’t think it will, because you’ve the sort of
talent that is rock-bottom foundation. You’re going to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
be immeasurably silly and have all kinds of notions and
adventures. I’m not interested in that part of your career.
I want you to be clear on this point.” As he
spoke, he seemed aloof, absolutely impersonal and removed
from workaday affairs, and Thurley experienced
the sensation of embarrassment at having asked him any
questions.</p>

<p>“Your voice is my hobby just now.” The enthusiasm
of youth was in his own. “It is God-given, art concealing
art. You have that fire, dash, <em>touch of strangeness</em>
that one sees very seldom. You really would have hard
work to spoil your voice, Thurley. Moreover, I would
have hard work to teach you how to sing. Are you surprised?
Oh, you thought as do so many that I would
teach you to sing as one learns to dance or paint on china,
some systematic, mechanical accomplishment ... all
wrong!” He brushed the entire range of keys with his
hands as if to express denial of the fact. “God taught
you to sing, Thurley. You sang as well in your Birge’s
Corners as you will sing in opera—and perhaps better.
But you need polish, general education along many lines,
endless drill and routine. As for singing, <i lang="la">per se</i>, there is
nothing I can teach or tell you. I can direct and restrain—that
is my part. So it is with all great artists,
the gift is quite complete and quite their own; it is for
them to be willing to be directed and not to shirk drudgery.”
He was about to add something else, something
which it seemed to Thurley was a secret of his very heart,
but he broke off abruptly with,</p>

<p>“Now, you young country scamp, sing hey and sing
ho, for you’re wasting time!” So taking her cue, Thurley
fell to work with a zest.</p>

<p>The lesson ended with a surprise.</p>

<p>“Try this aria of Rosina’s in ‘Barber of Seville’—the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
‘<i lang="it">Una voce poco fa</i>.’ I’ve a notion you can make it
celestial harmony if you like. If you can’t do the Italian,
take a syllable and stick to it. Now—” Handing her
the music he dashed into the aria in contagious spirit.</p>

<p>“Very bad,” he commented, making a wry face and
taking the music from her, “but that’s nothing against
the voice. A year from now we shall have the music
critics sitting up and exclaiming. Run along, Thurley,
and don’t let the rustic swains make you lose time from
your lessons.”</p>

<p>She was putting on her hat and fancied he could not
see her expression. But he surprised her with,</p>

<p>“You will have all the time in the world for nonsense
after you’ve mastered the things you need to know.
What you want to do is to put your heart in cold storage
for a while, as you did your sense of humor. Just be an
amiable and obedient genius-flapper and everything else
will true up and appear in due season, just as the curtain
speeches during the last act reveal the missing will,
the lost child and soften the irate parent’s heart against
the poor but proud hero.”</p>

<p>“But I don’t want always to have some part of me in
cold storage,” Thurley protested. “I’ve always been
such—such a very real person that it’s hard to—”</p>

<p>“Of course, that’s the best part of it. Easy things
never get you anywhere. Effective medicine is almost
always bitter.” He came to put his hands on her shoulders.</p>

<p>“Why, you’re not so old,” she said bluntly, “are
you?”</p>

<p>“Not half so old as I’d like to be; age is so safe, Thurley,
when you are dealing in temperament! You can
growl much more effectively.”</p>

<p>“You mean people fall in love with you?” she asked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
spiritedly. “Is that what you shrink from?” Her
naïve impertinence was unconscious.</p>

<p>“I cringe! Which is worse than mere shrinking.”
He gave her a little shake. “You funny, round-cheeked
girl, run along. You’ll be in opera before we realize it
and adopting the airs and graces of an empress. But I
shall remember you as the direct, rosy-cheeked young person
who demanded if I feared having people love me.”
His eyes closed briefly and then he whirled her around as
if she were a small boy. “Be off! Ah, yes, here’s a
note—I nearly did forget.” He reached in an inner
pocket and handed over a cream-colored envelope with
a heavy lavender seal.</p>

<p>“From her who you fancied was my wife,” he explained,
enjoying her confusion. “Ernestine Christian,
one of our ‘family.’ She does not start her season until
January, but then she’s going to tell you all that. You’ll
have to drive fast to be on time, for you’re to take tea
with her at half after four. And don’t forget two
things: First, you sang the aria in five-and-ten-cent
style; and, secondly, you’re a nice apple-cheeked kiddie
and deserve splendid things!” He waved her out jocularly,
and she found herself going through the anterooms
reading the note and not speaking to the secretary.</p>

<p>All it said was:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">Thurley Precore—</p>

<p>Come take tea with me at half-past four. Bliss says we are to
know each other.</p>

<p class="right">Ernestine Christian.</p>

</div>

<p>Here at least was a breathing space from lessons.
Some one had asked her to tea who would, one would
assume, be willing to answer questions. She called a cab
and drove to the address.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<p>Thurley had no calling cards—not every detail can be
achieved in a magical space of time—so she told the
maid to say it was Miss Precore and that she was expected.
At which she was shown into the strangest living-room,
to her untutored eyes, that she could imagine.
It had a black and white tiled floor and green Pompeiian
furniture with oddly shaped cushions in still odder places
and distinctive mirrors hung on dull, green chains. The
piano was in the center of the room and all about the
walls were bizarre black and white etchings and some
fascinating marines. At the end of the room, the light
striking it in excellent manner, was the portrait of a man.
As Thurley looked at it, she wondered if she was to go
from strange room to stranger room seeing portraits
which fascinated her and then meet their originals only
to gaze on another portrait equally strange and winsome.</p>

<p>This man was noticeable for his well-shaped head with
its short, dark hair and fine, large eyes, hazel she would
judge, slightly mocking and lying-in-wait in their expression.
They were encased with spectacles of scholarly
aspect. He had a womanish chin and the tortured, lined
brow of the apostle. Dressed in riding togs, he was sitting
on the bench of an old garden, one hand betraying
slim, artistic fingers as it rested on the head of a grizzled
dog.</p>

<p>Thurley was settling herself in a nearby chair, trying
to become accustomed to this very different sort of “scenery,”
when a woman began saying in a deep, rich voice,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>“Poor youngster, tired out, aren’t you? Was it
scales? How I hated them! Don’t worry, I shall not
ask you to sing. Put this cushion behind you—ah, here
we are.”</p>

<p>Thurley stared at her hostess, the same scarlet-lipped,
clever-faced woman of the portrait, her blue-black hair
combed high to-day and her spatulate hands clasping her
knee in boy fashion. She wore no jewelry, but a frock
the consonance of copper and silver. It gave the effect
of sunset over still water and a silver-coated Persian cat
stalked out to settle himself in the fold of her skirt.</p>

<p>“It was very good of you to ask me,” Thurley began,
feeling rather ill at ease.</p>

<p>“I never ask any one I don’t want. So don’t feel
obligated. Every one says I’m selfishness personified.
Bliss says you’re to be one of our family and I want to be
sort of elder sister—anyway, don’t you approve of tea
and scandal at the same time?” Her smile softened her
face. She reached over to a smoking stand and found a
cigarette.</p>

<p>Encouraged, Thurley leaned forward to say, “I’m
afraid I don’t know about the family. You see I’m quite
raw, as they say. And dreadfully confused. I find I
have to acquire so many things besides singing exercises.”</p>

<p>“I look back fourteen years and see myself as I look at
you. I was droll for a year or so. But Bliss claims you
have a sense of humor, so everything else will follow like
sheep. You don’t understand, do you?” she said kindly.
“Let’s see what the ‘family’ can do for you. Bliss is
such a bear at explaining that he has really turned you
over to me. You see, Thurley, there are so many hundreds
of the near-famous and so many truly-great persons
who abuse the name that a select little coterie of us—myself
and five others—after rather depressing and humorous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
experiences have formed what we call the family,
and we are going to adopt you. It’s quite a recommendation,
but you’ll realize it more five years from now. By
the way, I shall not ask you to smoke—bad for tender
throats.”</p>

<p>“How beautiful,” Thurley said softly, “a family!”</p>

<p>“Just a title, of course, but we have our parties and
our times together and we talk of what we like in the
manner we like—rather hard to plunge headlong into
the real meaning of things. I think Bliss was precipitate
in asking you to the Thursday dinner party.”</p>

<p>“He hasn’t.”</p>

<p>“But he will—that’s his way. He’s such a busy dear
that he never does things properly. Now in the family
are myself and Polly Harris, whom you’ll know better
after seeing than I can tell you. Remember she has a
Packard personality in that Lizzie Ford body of hers.
Then Collin Hedley—”</p>

<p>“The artist who did your picture?”</p>

<p>“The same. And Mark Wirth, as great a dancer as
you will ever see,” her lips folded into a displeased expression
but she did not explain the reason, “and Bliss
and there will be yourself. Then there are Sam Sparling,
the English actor, and the original of that portrait,” she
pointed to the man who had interested Thurley. “His
name is Caleb Patmore.”</p>

<p>“Why, he writes stories,” Thurley said. “Even
Birge’s Corners has become aware of him.”</p>

<p>“Bless his wicked heart!” Ernestine said swiftly.</p>

<p>Thurley began to wonder why Caleb Patmore ever
used any other woman as a model for heroines or Collin
Hedley for his paintings. Perhaps it was Ernestine’s
unusual fashion of dress which made every one feel that
she had worn only the least beautiful of her gowns or the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
careless, homely way she dressed her hair or her unjewelled,
ugly hands which could coax from the pianoforte
such music as Thurley had never dreamed could exist—or
her sarcastic worldliness tempered with a girlish idealism
which made her face bright with smiles. Then there
was the strange, restless sadness in her eyes and the way
the scarlet mouth had of dropping into hurt little curves,
symbolic of many things of which Thurley was still ignorant.
Ernestine Christian was indifferent, even insolent,
regarding her fame, but jealously proud of her theories
about it. And when she mentioned Bliss Hobart a
few moments later, she said enthusiastically,</p>

<p>“He is such a wonderful idealist, so tremendously sincere
and fearless! Most idealists lack the courage to
express themselves and they live and die with the world
no wiser, but Bliss—! some day, when you, too, have become
worldly wise and a bit tired ’way inside, you will
understand.”</p>

<p>To which Thurley innocently replied, “Is Caleb Patmore
an idealist?”</p>

<p>Ernestine began playing with the fringe of her sash.
“Now what do you think?”</p>

<p>Thurley looked at the portrait and then at her hostess.
“I don’t know,” she evaded.</p>

<p>“Tut-tut, tell me what you think! Never mind what
you know.”</p>

<p>“His novels, even though they sell in as small towns
as the Corners, are rather—rather—” She floundered
piteously.</p>

<p>Ernestine came to the rescue, her scarlet lips curving
down in hurt fashion as she answered, “His novels for
the most part comprise tattling on blondined art models—and
brides! Caleb believes that art must be on a
strictly commercial basis and that no art should be enduring,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
‘any more than a bath,’ as he explains, ‘but quite as
necessary and frequent.’”</p>

<p>“Oh, he is wrong!” Instinctively Thurley was displeased.</p>

<p>“May you always think so, but when the distressingly
rich wheeze up in satin-lined cabs and ask you to accompany
them to a distressingly vulgar palace and have you
sing a song or two at a thousand dollars each; when every
one comes salaaming and saluting you, and you, too, begin
to have visions of acquiring a vulgar palace all your own
and are, therefore, pompous and impossible as so many of
us foolish children of light allow ourselves to become;
when you look about the salon to select the richest husband
or admirer and deliberately neglect your voice for
your coiffure and your repertoire for your wardrobe—well,
perhaps you may withstand it, but it is a rare happening!
Bliss says he has yet to find it otherwise.”</p>

<p>“A thousand dollars a song.” Thurley recalled that
day—how many lifetimes ago—that Dan engaged her
to sing at his circus in connection with “the great swinging
man” and had emptied his spending-money pocket
into her ragged lap. “Oh, no, they only pay a thousand
dollars a song in one of Mr. Patmore’s novels.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Patmore,” continued the woman who loved him
more dearly than she did herself, “takes his copy from
friends, like a bee flitting here and there and returning to
the hive honey-laden. We have all accused him of hiding
behind screens to gain conversation.”</p>

<p>Thurley laughed. “Do they never tip over?”</p>

<p>“They do if we suspect he is behind them,” Ernestine
replied with a smile.</p>

<p>“What does he do with all his money? He must be
very rich if the reports are true. Why even at the Corners
we sold a hundred copies of ‘Victorious Victoria,’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
and it was stupid, even the description of a new way for
Victoria to be kissed.”</p>

<p>“‘Victorious Victoria’! It is engraven on my heart.
I tried harder to make him burn the manuscript than I
did to play well before Queen Mary and King George,”
she said in a dull voice. “Yet she was ‘Victorious Victoria,’
for she gave her sponsor a new motor and a lot of
foolish jewelry and a Japanese valet and some first editions
that he boasted of having wrenched from a millionaire
at an auction sale! You see, Caleb thinks there is no
need to sacrifice for one’s ideals or to be above a purchase
price for mediocre work. He says, ‘Writing is a trade.
We must all come in on a time clock or be taken to an
insane asylum. Give the public what it wants and with
their money we can buy what we want. Let the public
take the consequent softening of the brain. Younger
generations will always be appearing like spring violets
and measles to save us authors’ and artists’ bacon!’
There is the alpha and omega of his philosophy. One
might as well throw oneself against a stone fortress as to
make him reason otherwise. Blind, blind as an adder!”
She broke off abruptly to call Thurley’s attention to some
pottery she had picked up in Dutch Guiana which
could not be obtained save as one became a friend of the
natives.</p>

<p>Then a maid came in with the tea-cart and Ernestine
began asking as to “one lump or two—cream or sugar
or lemon.”</p>

<p>“Your dress is so interesting,” Thurley remarked to
break the lull.</p>

<p>“Thanks. I loathe clothes, yet have to have those
dreadful creations when I go on tour—the critics always
expect it. They put notices in the social columns, too!
My revenge will come when I am in the perilous forties.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
I shall be constantly clad in black chiffon and steel embroideries
with ermine and broadcloth for the outer
layers. I aspire to be the sort of older-than-I-look-but-not-yet-ancient
person who has the proper air of mystery,
always an asset, the sure, fine lines of a Helleu dry point,
you know.”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t know,” Thurley admitted drolly.</p>

<p>Ernestine clapped her hands. “Fine, we are coming
on! Take some more marmalade. Please don’t let
them spoil you, Thurley, you’re so nice as you are. I
mean the army of make-overs who assail any one with
ability. They have not begun attacks as yet. Wait
until you are asked for written recommendations and
some one invents a Thurley perfume. Oh, that you
might be spared!” She held up her hands in horror.</p>

<p>“Does Mr. Hobart really think I shall be a great
singer?” Thurley was experiencing her first stage
fright, hence the repetition.</p>

<p>“No one sees him the second time unless he does,”
Ernestine informed her. “Tell me about yourself. Remember
I’m a cross pianist who dislikes having ability
and yet would die if I did not. You can trust me, because
no one ever comes near me!”</p>

<p>“Don’t you adore your work?” Thurley asked in reproach.</p>

<p>Ernestine shook her head. “Really, I think genius is
something no other member of your family would countenance,
something your ancestors have saved up to hand
you unawares. I cannot help playing the piano. They
say I even make people <em>like</em> Bach, but I wish I could, for
it is life to me, after a fashion, and death after another.
You cannot mix house-and-garden living and a career any
more than oil and water. It must be the choice absolute
of one or the other. If a big person marries, she often<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
marries some one inferior and therein lies disaster.
Moral, do not marry.”</p>

<p>Thurley’s fingers stole inside her pocket to clutch at
the corner of Betsey’s letter. “But you can be happy,
if you do not marry,” she said uneasily.</p>

<p>“Has it begun to worry so soon? Wake up, Silver
Heels! Tell her there is much else besides the little hope-chest
crowded with pink-ribboned nighties and cook
books.” She stirred the Persian kitten with her slipper
toe.</p>

<p>“I—I’ve been engaged,” Thurley announced, not
knowing why.</p>

<p>“Of course you have, living in a small town and with
those eyes! Who was he—not the constable? I could
believe anything of you, Thurley, but that!” Ernestine
was kindly and teasing all in one.</p>

<p>“Just a nice boy,” she said with an effort, “but I gave
him up.”</p>

<p>“You did wisely. It is the trying to delude ourselves
to clutch with one hand for a laurel wreath and for
orange blossoms with the other. That is what makes us
failures on both sides of the question. You must see Collin’s
lovely country place up the Hudson, and we must go
to some lectures together. Besides, you have all Europe
to exclaim over. I’m going to walk through Spain next
summer. Come along?”</p>

<p>“I’d love to if—if I have the money—”</p>

<p>“We’ll find the money. You must do these things.
Bliss is making a little machine out of you with his
blessed, idealistic self, hidden like a monk under his habit.
Never mind—bright days for Young America—want
to hear me play?”</p>

<p>“Would you, really?”</p>

<p>“Listen!” Rising, she went to the piano and began<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
“The Two Larks,” gliding from that into some things
of Grieg.</p>

<p>When she finished, Thurley, ruthlessly scattering cake
crumbs, came beside her. The timid country girl had
vanished. She was the wild-rose Thurley with the “fire,
dash, touch of strangeness.”</p>

<p>“Let me sing for you! You can tell me the truth, better
than Mr. Hobart. Oh, but you can!” she begged.</p>

<p>Ernestine pointed to the shelves of music, but Thurley
shook her head.</p>

<p>“I’ll play for myself,” sitting on the bench beside her
hostess.</p>

<p>The chords were few and far between, but the girl’s
voice rose high and clear with the ethereal quality of a
child’s, as she sang an old Scotch ballad.</p>

<p>Ernestine Christian drew her to her with a sudden, deft
gesture. “Shall I pity or congratulate you?” she asked,
her sallow cheeks flushed with excitement.</p>

<p>Then they fell to talking, as women will, of lighter
things, and by degrees Thurley found herself in Ernestine
Christian’s bedroom—a striking affair in yellow lacquered
furniture with Chinese designs in gold, ivory walls
and huge, black fur rugs which she had brought from Russia.
There was point de venise and fillet lace over gray
silk for the furniture coverings and a veritable sheath of
photographs, among which Thurley found Bliss Hobart’s.</p>

<p>Then Thurley found herself taking note of Ernestine’s
gowns, learning many things which she resolved to put
into practice. She discovered that Ernestine Christian
had just celebrated her thirtieth birthday and was indifferent
to the fact in any way; that Bliss Hobart had had
a fever when a lad and hence the grayish hair; that Polly
Harris was as good a treat as a fairy pantomime but she
carried a heartbreak bravely concealed, for she loved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
Collin Hedley, the childish, irresponsible artist, and she
had not the greatness of genius in herself for which she
so longed. Also, there was a Madame Lissa Dagmar
whom Ernestine disapproved of but spoke no open ill
concerning. This Madame Dagmar threatened the welfare
of Mark Wirth, the dancer, for she had fallen in
love with him and turned his head with strange notions,
and, lastly, this Thurley’s woman heart told her, Ernestine
Christian loved the popular, irreverent novelist,
Caleb Patmore, but she believed marriage would interfere
with his work as well as her own, so she steadfastly
stood him off in that tantalizing fashion common
to women of brilliant attainments and childish, hungry
hearts.</p>

<p>When Thurley left her, the sting as to Lorraine and
Dan’s engagement had been spirited away—she knew
not how. Perhaps it was the graceful way in which Ernestine
had welcomed her, the new surroundings, the
music, the confidences about these “stars in the artistic
firmament,” as Birge’s Corners would have expressed it,
the knowledge she was to be one of the sacred family
which had hidden its existence even from press agents, or,
thrilling thought, that she was to be famous and rich—or
was it none of these? Was it that Thurley learned
more about Bliss Hobart?—that he was an idealist who
seldom expressed ideals, lest they become trampled upon
and return to him in cynical disguise; that he was not old
but young in fact and unmarried, and, as yet, interested
in no woman personally save as his two friends, Polly and
Ernestine, amused him; and, best of all, that he told
Ernestine to be particularly nice to Thurley Precore, nicer
than she had been to any other girl he had trained and
presented to the public!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<p>Hobart did invite Thurley to the family dinner party.
With customary tardiness the invitation did not reach her
until the afternoon of the day, late afternoon in fact,
after a fatiguing round of “polishings off,” as she dubbed
them, and an hour with Miss Clergy during which she
had read aloud from an archaic little romance and had
listened to the ghost-lady murmur her opinions.</p>

<p>Very swiftly it was becoming clear to Thurley that
fame, even the great, dazzling fame of which the workaday
world reads with awe, merely meant one had a different
standard of values; that all emotions such as joy,
sorrow, anger, renunciation, cowardice, heroism and so
on were relative. Tom Jones and wife and child in Skiddeoot,
Missouri, might attain as great joy over acquiring
a terrifically green-colored bungalow and veneered mahogany
to decorate the parlor, while Mrs. Tom was to
have a woman to wash, and Mr. Tom membership in the
Skiddeoot bowling club—quite as much joy as Ernestine
Christian when she stayed at Buckingham Palace an honored
guest and had on her dressing table the miniatures
of the young princes and a certain jewelled box given her
by the king of Italy. The lives of these luminaries, when
one came to know them on equal footing, were composed
of a multitude of trivial details, the same as were the
Joneses’ of Skiddeoot—the proper breakfast food, annoyance
of a thunder shower, the wrong-sized-gaiters, the
intense dislike of parsnips, the fondness for Japanese
prints, the staunch conviction as to when the world was to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
end, the way to eat one’s melons (in Skiddeoot it would
be porridge), the best style of spring motor car (in Skiddeoot
it would be whether to have the Ford wheels red
or yellow)—and so on through an endless list of things
about which physical and mental existence is centered.</p>

<p>Thurley had been exceptionally spared the grind and
slow advancement of the average artist. On the other
hand, she had experienced both grind and decidedly depressing
experiences during her travels in the box-car.
She was now placed, as it were, in the front ranks of the
artistic world and allowed to gaze about, investigate,
presume, acquire knowledge, as much as her own possibilities
would permit. Her possibilities being above the
average, Thurley, inside of the few months in New York,
had come to the settled conviction that folks were really
just folks no matter how they were dressed, and the artists
quite the same as the population of Birge’s Corners,
only in a different setting and with a different set of
values.</p>

<p>It was rather disappointing to come to the conclusion,
not at all romantic and stimulating or in keeping with the
conclusions Caleb Patmore’s “Victorious Victoria” had
arrived at in an amazingly short space of time. It was
like a child’s suddenly being put on everyday relations
With Santa Claus himself and finding out, besides his ability
to ride reindeer skyward, and, toy-laden, shoot down
narrow chimneys, that he had a gouty foot the same as
Oyster Jim’s, was rather caustic if his eggs were overdone,
was a Republican, body, boots and breeches, the
same as Ali Baba, and, if he lost three games of cribbage
straight running, was distinctly “peeved.”</p>

<p>So Thurley advanced beyond the illusions of the uninitiated.
Before she came into Bliss Hobart’s dominion
she had been one of the public, the sort of public who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
believe newspaper reports of opera singers having frolicsome
boa-constrictors as family pets, to welcome them
when they stagger home under van-loads of orchids from
the evening’s work! She saw now with the clear, innocent
eyes of youth, which is so often wiser than dictatorial
and narrow middle age, that the common lot was
the universal lot and that in the sum total of all things
the famous ones were spared no more nor less nor given
greater qualities of endurance or supreme power.</p>

<p>Had the invitation to the “family” dinner come a
week ago, Thurley would have hesitated before accepting.
But Ernestine Christian’s personality—as yet it
was not Ernestine Christian’s real self since she betrayed
that to no one—had woven a big-sister armor about
Thurley’s wild-rose self. She was eager to become one
of the family, unconscious of the honor for which many
had sighed and bribed for in vain. She showed the note
to Miss Clergy and became very flapperlike on the subject
of her costume.</p>

<p>“Wear any you like,” Miss Clergy said fondly.
“Dear me, I sha’n’t go. I’m an old lady, sleepy as an
infant by half after eight.”</p>

<p>“Must I always be alone?” Thurley protested.</p>

<p>Miss Clergy, whose girlhood had been bounded on all
sides by the “Polite Letter Writer” and “Godey’s
Lady’s Book,” hesitated. “Take a maid,” she urged.</p>

<p>“For protection? Goodness, no! Why, I’ve walked
at midnight in the darkest road at home, when Philena
would be taken very ill and we had to have the north
end doctor. I’ll go alone—and wear my green velvet.”</p>

<p>“If you want more dresses—” began Miss Clergy
cheerily. When one had a wild-rose girl with the voice
of a lark, revenge just naturally lost its grim and ugly
aspects.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>But Thurley shook her head and vanished, singing
snatches of her exercises and finding out that she was not
so tired as she had fancied; the languor had magically
vanished. She propped Hobart’s tantalizing note on her
dressing table as she did her hair.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">Thurley—</p>

<p>Come and be christened at seven-thirty. The family must
know the baby.</p>

<p class="right">B. H.</p>

</div>

<p>Thurley deliberately powdered her face and added a
soupçon of superfluous rouge. She was thinking, “Now
I shall know the real man, the real Bliss Hobart,” dropping
into a hum instead of singing aloud, always a symptom
of rare joy.</p>

<p>Presently she appeared to say good night to Miss
Clergy, a radiant young person looking, as Caleb Patmore
said afterwards, “an up-to-date historical romance
bound in green velvet and silver lace.” But she was disappointed
in Hobart’s apartment, for she realized at a
glance it was only more of his “setting”; that here he
existed as Bliss Hobart the critic and master, not Bliss
Hobart the man. It was equally as awesome as his
studio offices, but in a more distinguished, definite style.
There was rare, decorative wall paper, with shellacked
panels set in the yellow, marbleized walls reproducing the
design made by David for the great Napoleon. Black,
velvety carpet covered the tiled floors, the chairs were of
deep mouse color edged with gold fringe, there were pale
gray hangings against shell pink satin screens and a tiled
Portuguese mantel of blue and yellow.</p>

<p>She found Ernestine Christian and Caleb Patmore
waging a lively argument, with Bliss Hobart enjoying it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
hugely. Nor did they stop after Thurley’s bashful entrance
and Hobart’s introduction,</p>

<p>“The family infant! Remember, ‘children should be
seen and not heard.’ There’s the chair for you, and if
you are very ‘pie’ and don’t contradict your elders, you’ll
be rewarded later.”</p>

<p>Thurley accepted the rôle gladly. It was evident they
considered her a promising infant. Some day she would
be able to tell them the same half-patronizing things or
be introducing some other prodigy into the family in
equally clever, blasé fashion. That first and memorable
dinner party was more of an education than all the lessons
Thurley had endured since her New York advent. Here
she saw the demonstration of the theories taught her regarding
form, cleverness and so on. Long before the
evening was ended, she felt she could now dispense with
the social secretary, the beauty doctor and the gymnast.
She had only to observe her “family” and practise the
results of the observation before her mirror.</p>

<p>“We are waiting for Polly Harris and Collin Hedley,”
Hobart remarked during a lull in the battle. “Polly is
as punctual as an alarm clock, but Collin would not be on
time at his own funeral, if it were possible. We always
give him a half hour leeway and never mind because Polly
is such fun when she rages.”</p>

<p>Thurley murmured some reply, and then Caleb Patmore,
who had been looking at her almost rudely, began
anew his argument. Despite his depraved ideas regarding
novel writing, Thurley liked him. He had the clean-cut
business air which she admired, rather than the air
of the proverbial long-haired novelist with a hemstitched
neck scarf.</p>

<p>“Of course we respect Daphne,” he said grudgingly.
“For five years she has made her living writing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
poetry—<span class="smcapuc">POETRY</span>—and how many can say as much? No bribes
of the corset makers for limerick advertisements ever
tempted her, but now she has sensibly surrendered in
favor of marrying one Oscar Human, Indiana plumber at
large. The only remarkable thing about it is that Oscar
Human would marry a failure poetess who must have
forgotten how to cook a boiled dinner or be interested in
the new style nickel fittings! Well, luck to Daphne
Rhodes, but what good was it all? A starved, embittered
space filler, she admitted, soothing a makeup man’s
difficulties by rounding out the page with a plump sonnet.”</p>

<p>Ernestine walked over to the mantel in order to look
as majestic as possible, so Hobart called out. She was
very lovely in her crystal colored satin with silvery
panels and those interesting, homely hands of hers
clasped awkwardly.</p>

<p>“You do love fleshpots, Caleb, no matter whether an
Indiana plumber or an editor bestows them. You’ll have
Daphne taking orders for your next novel, I dare say—a
premium with every new kitchen sink Oscar installs!
You wretch! I’ve no doubt Daphne is going to be
happy, at least her experience as a poetess will mercifully
teach her never to let this Oscar know how commonplace
he is. Therein will lie the success of the union. As soon
as Polly comes, we’ll decide on the wedding present.
For my part, I think Daphne has done a brave thing to
hold to the best in herself, and, when she saw she was
unable to attain her goal, to drop back gracefully into the
house-and-garden rank and file.”</p>

<p>Caleb shrugged his shoulders. “Well, long ago I became
tired of being a literary chameleon and trying to
match up every editor’s bark! I found out what the
reading public wanted and I have given it to them—great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
hunks of it! I haven’t come out so badly, eh?
Now, Daphne could have done the same.” He leaned
back in his chair looking defiantly at Ernestine.</p>

<p>“You are trying to make me the man in the divorce
case; his wife took the furniture and the five children and
he took the blame. But I challenge you, Caleb, to prove
that you have ever really written a good story—a story
you felt and loved and were willing to fight for until it
was printed.”</p>

<p>“You’ve never gone through my attic trunks,” he reminded.
“Besides, the public doesn’t like highbrow
stories. They like stories about people who are capable
of wearing pink underwear, and a villain must be a villain
if found carrying a riding crop. Just when I am settled
in my mind concerning my next heroine, Ernestine breaks
out with uplift, as annoying as to have a motor stuffed
with relatives drive up to the door at dinner time,” he
informed Hobart. “Can’t you lend a hand?”</p>

<p>“How can I, when I want to stay friends with you
both? By Jove, there’s the bell; they’ve arrived.”</p>

<p>Ernestine blew Caleb a kiss and murmured, “If one
cannot write <i lang="fr">au naturel</i>, I presume it must be <i lang="fr">au gratin</i>!”</p>

<p>Then there swept into the room two of the strangest
and most delightful persons Thurley had ever seen.
Collin Hedley came first, a fair-haired, boyish man with
eyes so joyous and brilliant one could not look at them
for long, and the bristly head of the plebeian with deep
incurvation of the temples. He was most carelessly
dressed, but no one would have noticed that as long as
his eyes smiled; he had a mad Van Dyke beard and a
lovable yet combative mouth which might or might not
prophesy many things.</p>

<p>But it was Polly Harris who captivated Thurley’s heart
and made her forget her shyness. Polly had the fashion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
of bombarding one’s self-consciousness. She could
have changed the saying, “A cat may look at a king” to
“a cat may order a king.” Even Bliss Hobart lost dignity
in her presence.</p>

<p>“Polly can teach you to write <i lang="fr">vers libre</i> on your cuff
and tell a Chicago art patron from a Pittsburg coal dealer
at a distance of fifty yards,” was Hobart’s universal recommendation.
But Polly Harris could do a great deal
more.</p>

<p>She reminded one, although her age was less than Ernestine’s,
of October sunshine, partly because she was a
tiny, wood-brown thing, an oddity, a fact she well knew,
flat-chested as a boy, with tanned skin, eyes like topazes,
if she were happy, and her brown hair bobbed like a
child’s and fastened with a ridiculous velvet bow. Her
dresses were inevitably the same—since her income was
likewise—Polly’s regimentals, they called them, brown
corduroy for winter, made in semi-smock, semi-Eton-jacket
style with an abbreviated skirt and stout little boots
laced as if for a walking tour. In the summer Polly
appeared in brown cotton made in similar fashion and
when she was dragged to some formal affair she would
be induced to wear her “heirloom,” a brocaded brown
velvet which Ernestine had brought from Paris. Polly
was just Polly with her crisp little voice, a heart of gold
and a tongue which could be sharp as a battle lance or
as tender as pink rosebuds.</p>

<p>“The only sprite in captivity,” the family dubbed her,
pitying her impossible aim—to write grand opera—and
never hinting what tragedy lay before her when the
tanned face would wrinkle and the bobbed hair turn
gray. It was as probable that Polly Harris could write
a grand opera as that Betsey Pilrig could lead the Russian
ballet—but Polly, as so often happens in the case<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
of “captured sprites,” saw none of the absurdity encasing
her ambitions.</p>

<p>No one knew just how she lived, for she had the fierce
pride of failures. “Sure ’nuff” successes or “comers”
are always more amenable to loans and helping hands.
In her sky parlor, the tiptop room in a bohemian New
York rooming house, Polly somehow wrested from fate
and the world at large a living. Limericks and hack
work of hideous monotony and starvation wage with the
pride of her family behind her! Her father had been an
Ohio judge and her grandfather a senator, while Polly,
alone and without resources, had wilfully burned family
bridges some years before and drifted to New York to
write her operas.</p>

<p>Even Polly admitted the first operas were hopeless,
bravely burning them as one does old love letters. But
grand opera remained her goal; nothing less would or
could satisfy her. After seven desperate years of work
and insufficient means, Polly had become one of the family
of the very great and was envied by all; it meant,
however, that she took from this family not one jot
of aid or influence nor permitted them to know whether
“we are eating to-day or we are moving our belt strap
into the next hole.”</p>

<p>Sometimes the family outwitted Polly Harris and
helped her in spite of herself, but more often they knew
it was kindest to not try. So they did the finest thing
of all because the girl’s fine self deserved and demanded
it—they took her in as one of them and talked of the
day her operas should be sung, listening to her pitiful
dreams as kindly as they would have listened to Wagner
could he have been among them telling of his Rhinegold!
Polly had become a character in artistic New York and
when the near-great enviously urged her to make use of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
the truly great, to accept some easy position as secretary
or companion to this celebrity or that, Polly’s eyes would
change to angry, storm things and she would turn on
them with the threat that they would still see her win
out, some day the great theme would come to her and the
world admit her success! Then she would repay the
beloved family for their kindness in not forcing old
clothes and baskets of food, loans of money—as one
tipped a maid. Polly would be famous, as famous as
Ernestine Christian or Bliss or the lazy deceiver of a
Caleb or Collin Hedley whom Polly loved in strange fashion
although he was honestly unconscious of the fact.</p>

<p>Until then painting lamp shades at night, writing
wretched verse for some wretched publication, doing a
child’s song cycle for almost the cost of the music paper,
harmonizing impossible marching songs, substituting at
a Harlem movie house as the piano player—none of
these was too mean for Polly to do since they sustained
her until the day the great theme should whisper itself!</p>

<p>“The thing which keeps Polly afloat,” Ernestine had
declared, “is that she is glad for every one else who
wins out—it has made her so sunny hearted she just
can’t go under.”</p>

<p>Polly approached Thurley with open arms, saying in
her crisp fashion, “Bliss tells me you have never known
father, mother nor telephone number and we can baby
you all we like,” bending down unexpectedly to kiss
her.</p>

<p>Before Thurley answered, Polly whirled around to demand,
“Listen, every one, I’ve come to the conclusion
we should all be thankful for anything that makes cold
chills go up and down our spines,” dashing into some
nonsensical adventure told in her own fashion.</p>

<p>Hobart waited until the conclusion, after which he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
offered Thurley his arm and led the way into the dining
room which proved to be an enclosed sort of terrace
with wonderfully imitated flowering shrubs, green striped
awnings, a lily pool fountain giving a touch of the unreal
and illusive. Wicker chairs, artificial ascension lilies and
Canterbury bells were in profusion. The room was
called the “village green,” Caleb whispered to Thurley,
and on nights when the thermometer skidded below zero,
Hobart delighted to come into this exquisite little oasis
of almost tropical heat and make his guests forget the
sleet and frost without. Two chairs were tipped against
their well appointed places, one for Mark Wirth, the
dancer, and one for Sam Sparling, the actor, Thurley
learned, a family custom always observed.</p>

<p>As they sat about the table, Thurley between Polly
and Collin, Polly remarked naïvely:</p>

<p>“I’m trying to get Collin to tell me why women who
dabble in water colors always paint ‘Pharaoh’s Horses’
with chests like inflated, tuppenny balloons?”</p>

<p>“How can a mere painter of fried egg sunsets answer?”
he retorted. “Oh, I say, about Daphne’s wedding
present—Polly doesn’t want to send it.”</p>

<p>At which a chorus of “why nots” issued, to which
Polly said forcibly:</p>

<p>“Because it will remind her of what she can never
have. Pick out some nice, golden oak and green plush
article which will do credit to the establishment of one
Oscar Human, plumber at large. It will be salve on a
throbbing wound. Daphne will think, bless her amateurish
old heart, that it is <em>our</em> choice and being typical of the
golden oak and green plush atmosphere which must always
be hers, she’ll still feel one of us! But that green
metal desk set with silver trim—horrors, think of its
shivering with loneliness in Oscar’s back parlor!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>“Right,” Hobart added, “I’ll get the picture of a
wistful tabby cat staring at oysters fairly shivering in
their shells and a battenberg doily underneath—no, that
would be too broad—we’ll get—I say, here’s our infant
fresh from Birge’s Corners and Birge’s Corners’
brides—nearly one herself if the truth were known!
What ho, Thurley, what would you propose to give a
Birge’s Corners’ bride that would meet the town’s approval?”</p>

<p>Flushing as she thought of Lorraine’s chest of linens,
the new house which was to cost twenty thousand dollars—and
then of Ernestine’s necklace which cost that alone—Thurley,
without hesitation, answered, “Why, a cut
glass punch bowl with the silver hooks all around it for
the little glasses!”</p>

<p>“The infant is christened,” Hobart pronounced after
the applause ended. “I nominate a shopping committee
of Ernestine Christian and Thurley Precore.”</p>

<p>During the rest of the supper party Thurley remained
a spectator until Hobart whispered that she sing for them
and she rose, for the first time in her life, reluctant to
obey.</p>

<p>“She has not done well,” she heard Hobart saying
as she finished, “stage fright—too few of us—too
small a room—the opera stage, five thousand people and
she would sing as if her throat were copper lined—however—”</p>

<p>Polly Harris finished the sentence for him. “However,
if Ernestine wisely realizes the limitations of the
pianoforte, Thurley Precore will never have to realize
the limitations of her voice.”</p>

<p>Caleb took Ernestine and Thurley home in his machine,
Collin and Polly following in the former’s roadster.
Being the infant, Thurley was left at her hotel first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
of all with fond good nights and quips about the sandman’s
speedy arrival! She regretted that she was not
allowed to whirl about taking Polly home and then Collin
and then Ernestine and, finally, to be left alone with this
rich, willful novelist-slacker and have him tell about his
world even as Ernestine had hinted of hers.</p>

<p>As she undressed, the memories of the evening being
rehearsed by her dramatic self and shamedly admitting
she had been a stupid country lass who had not sung
one-tenth as well as she could, Thurley realized another
valuable thing, one which the public does not take the
pains to decipher, that artists, in order to be successes,
must, <i lang="la">per se</i>, acquire definite and almost narrow ways and
methods of living such as dressing, recreation and so on,
<em>their personalities must crystallize and become impenetrable
to the onslaught of the personalities which they
will undertake to interpret or create</em>. Here, in part, lies
the secret of fame. Once one has one’s own self quite
modelled and secure from invasion, the tortures of creation
and interpretation become but the day’s work just as
the man with grimy hands polishes the most expensive
limousine body and returns homeward via a street car.</p>

<p>The members of the family had distinct and original
personalities—true, they did not seem to be the complement
of their forms of artistic achievement; Collin’s
pictures never reminded one of Collin nor Ernestine’s
programs have many of her own favorites, but back of
their work, a haven to temperament, stood these people’s
personalities which carried them bravely on the
tidal wave of success. Whether or not something else
stood behind these personalities and formed the universal
trinity of expression was to be determined later—when
one did not suggest cut glass punch bowls with hooks as
wedding gifts!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>But as Thurley lay down to sleep, too excited to remember
Birge’s Corners, she determined with amusing
worldliness to set to work developing her own personality,
to both pamper and crystallize it, pitting it against this
wild rose Thurley who blushed and who sneezed—unpoetic
truth—just when she should not!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<p>Instead of the Christmas season making Thurley homesick,
it lent a vivacious joy that caused Ernestine Christian
and Polly Harris to marvel at her development.
The atmosphere of the city had its foothold. She
thought, if at all, of the Christmas preparations in Birge’s
Corners, with passing scorn.</p>

<p>Thurley’s thoughts had been rather well regulated by
routine until she was left with but scant time for
reminiscence. No lesson had been done away with but
more added. She spent twice as much time at Hobart’s
studio, either with him or with the Bohemian singing
teacher whom she loathed but who knew how to guide her
voice into unsurpassed channels.</p>

<p>Then there were hateful languages to conquer and,
if she disliked the social secretary or the gymnast or
the corps of other workers who were making her
“ready” to sing for her supper on the opera stage, they
continued to appear at regular intervals until Thurley
realized that Bliss Hobart had had method in his madness,
for he had seen the need of curbing a rebellious
and turbulent spirit, one that tired too quickly of routine
for its own good. In reality, he was teaching her the
grind, which most artists never escape, in a condensed
and merciful fashion.</p>

<p>Thurley was beginning to realize even more of this
great question of “values.” In the old days at the
Corners when gray, sullen moods conquered her sunny
self, she had been wont to take refuge within the box-car<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
wagon or the hilly cemetery, to sob without reason
or plan rebellions of which neither Dan nor Betsey Pilrig
could have had the slightest understanding! Now
she called a taxi and drove through the parks or out
suburban roads, thinking the same quality of thoughts
with different and widely varied guises and returning,
as she had done from the box-car wagon or cemetery, light
hearted, dangerously glad for every one, singing like a
meadow lark and insisting on doing things for whosoever
might come her way almost to the extent of exaggeration.</p>

<p>Formerly, when saddish longings and presentiments
would sweep over the wild rose Thurley, she had tramped
through the pine woods as sturdily as a soldier under
his captain’s orders, tramping, tramping, tramping up
through the amphitheater of hills which lay outside the
town. Finally, she would come upon a pasture clearing
and here she would sit, exhausted but filled with sweet
contentment, at the “top of the world” she fondly
called it, looking down at the little village which seemed
a cardboard play-town and dreaming of the day when
she should stand at the top of the world to sing and
all the cardboard towns in the universe should listen and
applaud.</p>

<p>In New York, Thurley took another method when pessimism
interrupted common sense routine. She went to
the piano and practised until her throat gave warning
to cease and she could again face the world as the wild-rose-with-a-prophecy-of-the-hothouse-variety Thurley,
baby of the great “family,” an interesting young goddess
who seldom voiced an opinion but who could sweep
away opinions if she sang a ballad (unbeknownst to her
present audience) with thoughts of Dan or Philena or
the old days in the wagon as the inspiration!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<p>During those effervescent moods of abandon which
fairly intoxicated all those who saw Thurley under their
spell—back in the Corners—she had always rushed
down to the emporium and coaxed Dan away on a
frolic—a picnic, if summer, or skating, if winter. They
would sit, these two, on the porch of a deserted lake mansion
dreaming dreams of a lyric quality with a sincerity
which made both the boy and the girl the better
for having dreamed them! Thurley would weave garlands
of wild flowers—Dan gathering them—and she
would come home to Betsey Pilrig, her cheeks like roses
and her eyes like stars, singing a spring song and causing
Betsy to lapse into Ali Baba’s favorite expression,
“Land sakes and Mrs. Davis—Thurley, be you from
another world?”</p>

<p>The joyous moods, these days, came very seldom. To
some degree they happened when Ernestine told her that
Hobart was pleased with her progress or when Polly
Harris kissed her and said she was a little sister to the
great; some faint imitation of them was experienced
when Caleb took her motoring and told her his humorous
troubles or when she went with Miss Clergy and
Hobart to the first opera—“Rigoletto”—and saw with
the grave, conceited eyes of youth herself outshining the
present <i>Gilda</i>—herself standing with outstretched arms
to acknowledge the applause. The wild joy was felt
for half an instant when Collin Hedley said he would
paint the infant before her début—there would be no
fun at all in painting her when she was famous and
unapproachable, waving engagement tablets at a mere
artist.</p>

<p>Thurley came to realize clearly the difference in the
inspiration of her joy—the joy which had been her
solace during the gray, hungry days of childhood. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
Birge’s Corners supreme mirth came from smell of new
mown hay, with sunshine sparkling all about, or the
summer breeze kissing the little curls at the delicious
nape of her white, soft neck—it was generated by the
discovery of the first violets or the exhilaration of a
skating party with Dan, by some baby’s laughing face or
Betsey’s pleased smile—and most of all by Dan’s ardor.
Thurley told herself with almost shamed admission that
her values had changed.</p>

<p>But if Thurley changed quickly during the winter,
Miss Clergy stayed the same feeble, at times querulous,
ghost lady, always willing for Thurley to go to places
without her, trusting the girl as one would trust a matron,
content, now that she had roused from her neurotic
lethargy, to lapse into a semi-doze with a vigilant eye
for only two things—to have Thurley succeed as a <em>spinster</em>
and to have no one become personally acquainted
with her own withered self lest memories be unearthed
over which she mourned in vain.</p>

<p>So Thurley came and went at will and the family
became used to the fact that the infant’s benefactress
was a “character.” For that matter the family themselves
were characters with pet “phobias” and hobbies
and theories, to say nothing of scars, cotton-wooled and
well protected from the bromidic world.</p>

<p>It was Christmas week when Thurley experienced a
savage mood—anger really the stimulus—for she had
bought a supply of frocks and hats preparatory to the
“family’s” Christmas festivities when Ernestine wrote
her a note from Chicago, where she was playing engagements,
saying that she would not be home until
January and she was writing before Christmas purposely
because she never had believed in the holiday and neither
gave nor accepted gifts; therefore she wished the child-Thurley<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
all good things and to work as hard as she
could; she would see her within a few weeks.</p>

<p>The savage mood began to manifest itself as Thurley
read the careless note. Like the writer, its force and
decision were unquestionable. Thurley had prepared
gifts for all members of the family in the same impulsive
fashion as for every one she had loved back
at the Corners. She went to the bureau drawer and
opened it to examine them—they seemed garish and
absurd. She was not yet at the topnotch of fame
which allows one to do whatsoever one will and have it
accepted. If she had made her début and chosen to
present Ernestine Christian with one of those gilded
rolling pins with a regiment of hooks which hung on the
doors of many of the best families in the Corners, it
would have been received in resigned silence. As it was,
the purse she had chosen for Ernestine was probably
not at all what she would have liked; Thurley would give
it to the room maid instead. She would think it quite
wonderful and carry it for shopping or Sunday mass!</p>

<p>She looked at the handkerchiefs she had for Polly
Harris—but Polly would probably make some sarcastic
squib at their expense and never be seen with one protruding
from her smock pocket. No, the handkerchiefs
would do for the social secretary and the antique leather
box for Caleb she would press upon the gymnast, while
the book on art originally intended for Collin would be
relegated to the scrap heap! Thurley laughed aloud as
she thought of giving Collin a book on art—when Collin,
foremost portrait painter in America, had written
a book on art which was used as an authority by the
younger school ... well, it had not been so very long
since she had bought her gifts at Dan’s store with Dan refusing
her money and had done them up in white tissue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
and the reddest of red ribbon, flying about like a good
fairy on Christmas Eve to leave them at doorsteps!
After re-reading Ernestine’s note, Thurley came to the
conclusion that Christmas was not for those afflicted with
exaggerated ego but merely for those who held good
jobs.</p>

<p>She had bought no present for Sam Sparling or Mark
Wirth, the latter still abroad, and as for Bliss Hobart,
her fingers fearfully touched the carved idol—a metal
Buddha mounted on teakwood. Why she had selected
it, after endless excursions to endless shops, Thurley did
not know—perhaps it was because she had never seen
one in his office where there was everything else under
the sun from a Filipino kris to a bibelot which had belonged
to Marie Antoinette. Or perhaps there was
another reason—at any rate, she had recklessly bought
the idol and sacrificed her spending money for a month to
come, blushing furiously each time she planned what to
write on the accompanying card.</p>

<p>She could hardly give the Buddha to a bellboy and
she had purchased black gloves for Miss Clergy, the
presents for Betsey, Ali Baba and Hopeful being on their
way.</p>

<p>She pushed the Buddha back in the drawer and went
to her lesson with Hobart with a reserved, patronizing
manner which amused him and his amusement, in turn,
angered Thurley.</p>

<p>Fame seemed something which would strangle everything
commonplace and joyous, Thurley thought, as she
mechanically did her exercises. These persons were so
<em>ultra</em>, so fond of “<em>my</em> taste in dress”—“the way I eat
<em>my</em> artichokes”—“the sort of wall paper in <em>my</em> studio”—so
over developed and emphasized that they made
clever, well bred fun of the “pastoral joys,” as Ernestine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
named them, all the while amusingly unconscious of the
whine of conceit which crept into their voices whenever
they made a drastic statement.</p>

<p>There ought to be a refined, sulphitic, fumigated holiday
just for this sort of people, Thurley thought. She
was driving home and watching the crowds of shoppers
laden with packages who tried to make their way across
the street. They were good-natured crowds because they
were buying something for some one else and she longed
to leave the cab and be one with them, to jostle and sway
together until the traffic signal was given and then to dash
across to reach a crosstown car and to end, breathless,
disordered of hat and hair but happy, in some small home
where the packages were relegated to the top shelf and a
recital of the day’s happenings told to the master of the
household over a supper of steak, coffee and baker’s
pie!</p>

<p>Up to this moment Thurley had not experienced homesickness,
but as the cab shot on in patrician fashion she
began recalling the fattened turkey they would have at
Birge’s Corners and the way Betsey had made her pudding
and Christmas cakes days before, as well as the
nights Dan had called for her to have her aid in trimming
the store windows with make-believe fireplaces
and tinsel stars; the way the boys and girls went into
the woods for the smallest fir trees and decorated the
church until it was “a bower of beauty,” according to
the <cite>Gazette</cite> report; how the choir would practise the
Christmas anthem and carols night after night with Thurley
directing, playing the organ and singing. On Christmas
morning would come the service with Thurley, the
envy of every girl in town because of her new pin or
bracelet or chain which Dan had given her, singing “The
Birthday of a King” in a glorious, clear voice—like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
some one permitted to sing down from the clouds for an
instant!</p>

<p>Oh, it was good to remember—<em>good?</em>—Thurley’s
eyes filled with tears. She told the man to drive on until
she ordered him to turn back to her hotel. She
laughed as she snuggled down in the machine, drawing
a robe over her lap and prepared to dream-remember.
As she did so, she recalled Caleb Patmore’s saying to
Ernestine one afternoon at tea,</p>

<p>“I’m going into the ooze again.” To which Ernestine
answered,</p>

<p>“Jolly lark, isn’t it? Don’t make it a habit or you
may slip into it altogether—then you would be helpless.”</p>

<p>“Take the advice for yourself,” he had retorted, to
which she nodded her head and the subject was dropped.
When Thurley asked her about it, Ernestine said with a
trace of confusion,</p>

<p>“You child, you’re not ready for any ‘ooze’ game
yet; you are still in it in actuality to an extent. When
you begin to want to go to nerve specialists and are not
hungry enough for bread and butter but keen on frosted
cake as it were, knowing nothing but work and wanting
to know nothing but play, when your day’s program—not
the one written by your press agent—is as impossible
as a typewritten love letter, you’ll find the ooze.
I’ll show you how to find it.”</p>

<p>But Thurley had insisted, like a true Pandora, upon
knowing and so Ernestine good-naturedly tried to explain.</p>

<p>“My nice creature, when people are so famous they
experience loneliness because they are quite shut away
from those who are quite famous, they cannot exist on
work no matter in what line their talent may be—nor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
on lollipop praise of the public nor carping criticisms.
They must have an antidote. Yet they cannot sacrifice
their relentless system of life which takes a first mortgage
on their time and energy. So while you hear of us as
having huge poultry farms and see our pictures taken in
the act of garroting a red pepper from Madame So and
So’s truck farm where she spends most of her time when
not—and so on, or read an interview in which one of
us declares a submarine boat to be our favorite siesta
spot, please know it is not true. But throughout the
years of endless work and surrender of the mystical force
constituting genius, we have just to be children—and
pretend. There, that is the whole thing in a nutshell—pretend
just as children fancy themselves policemen,
motormen, kings and fairy queens all the while swallowing
the mortification of domineering nurses and bibs.
We live with our memories, many times, if they are
pleasant. How rich a confession Caleb could wring out
of us, if he were not so sluggish! We dream-play, fancy,
create a world within a world. Bliss Hobart in a fit of
cynicism—I noticed he began taking pepsin the following
week—named it ‘the ooze’—and it became our trade
name for it. The ooze, the unreal, really unimportant
and absurd, yet ready to be lived with and yet to vanish,
the state of mind which we people as we wish and live
house-and-garden lives for as much as half an hour at
a time! You may not give this credence, but it is quite as
real as my piano or Collin’s brush. And heaven grant
you won’t need the ooze, Thurley, for a little! Still, it is
a lovely, plastic state of thought—like those lavender
and gold butterflies you find lingering in the corners of
Whistler’s paintings or that flutter in the margins of
special editions.”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you have the—the ooze be real—live<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
a fifty-fifty sort of existence?” Thurley borrowed Dan’s
slang.</p>

<p>“It would be like blending chilblains and poetry or
mosquitoes and mahogany—impossible! That is why
they say all genius is a trifle mad. Remember, the ooze
is your best friend! Why, after a fatiguing concert, I’ve
played I was the bustling, happy mother of half a dozen
youngsters, the type of American housewife who does
all her work except the washing and whose hands grow
red and hardened yet are sparkling with diamonds, whose
children grow up and adore her—I’ve lived in a red
brick house with those diamond-shaped panes at the front
windows and dotted muslin curtains criss-crossed—you
know—and I’ve entertained bridge clubs galore, making
mayonnaise and maple parfait myself while the baby
was napping—” and when Thurley had clamored for a
clearer understanding, Ernestine ordered her off to study
her French and forget she shared the secret of the
“ooze.”</p>

<p>“What is Bliss Hobart’s ooze?” she had insisted.</p>

<p>“I think he plays he runs an ice cream soda fountain in
Harlem,” Ernestine had answered to be rid of her. At
the time Thurley had seriously questioned Ernestine’s
sanity.</p>

<p>But this snowy December night the ooze became very
real to her and, unknowingly, Thurley passed a telling
boundary line of progress. She dreamed on of Birge’s
Corners—she saw the Christmas entertainment taking
place. There was the awful make-believe chimney which
the Sunday-school superintendent, invariably the thinnest
man in town, was to descend, fragments of his cotton
beard floating about the stage after the feat was accomplished.
She could see the primary class waving the
red satin banner symbolic of the best attendance—strange,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
how excellent is the Sunday-school attendance
during holiday season—and then marching on the stage
to sing in a series of mouse-like squeaks, “Jolly Old
Saint Nicholas” while their teacher, in love with Jo
Drummer, the Santa Claus, stood below to direct them
and wonder if Jo was properly impressed with her maternal
devotion and her new hat.</p>

<p>Then the minister “delivered” a few remarks and
Lorraine came on the stage to hand out tarlatan stockings
with nuts and hard candies which accompanied the gifts.
After laborious recitations by tortured boys with slicked-back
hair and freckles pale because of the excitement, the
town elocutionist let loose with “How They Brought
the Good News from Aix to Ghent” or “The Wreck
of the Hesperus” and about at this juncture the stage
chimney would crash down and reveal the truth—it was
nothing but a lot of brick-paper pasted on Dan Birge’s
store boxes!</p>

<p>Well, it was fun to play that one was taking part in
the entertainment and showing off a little, as every one
else did, including the minister, to smell, in imagination,
the pines and evergreens and to visualize Dan Birge, the
handsomest lad in the assemblage, winking at her during
the minister’s address!</p>

<p>The river wind swept in through the lowered taxicab
window-pane and Thurley leaned forward to say,
“Home, please”—the ooze drifting obediently away.
She was Thurley Precore, the Thurley with rejected
Christmas gifts and the prospect of a hotel holiday dinner
in company with Miss Clergy who would nap most
of the day!</p>

<p>Yet the ooze had stimulated Thurley; she could always
go slipping back to the Corners to relive the homey
things which had made her a wild rose. It appeared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
to be tremendously comforting and she went a step further
in self-analysis, telling herself, as she was going
up to the hotel rooms, that the thing which made great
people lapse into the ooze for tangled up nerves and
snarly frames of mind was the thing which made sarcastic,
aloof Ernestine Christian play a gypsy dance
with the wild fire its author intended it to have or gave
Caleb the power to invent an entirely new setting for
the same old, “Will you love me?” or told Collin how to
forget the ingrowing chin of his subject and make it
strong and masterful still <em>looking like</em> the ingrowing
original—here, Thurley took the lesson home for she,
too, was crystallizing her personality. It gave Thurley
the ability to feel that she was Juliet in the tomb or
Rosina having that delightful music lesson with her masquerading
lover, it was temperament, psychic masquerading!
There, that was a much nicer name than the ooze
and when she was famous enough she would tell Bliss
Hobart so and make him admit his clumsiness of nomenclature.</p>

<p>After which exhilaration came the hint of a warning—Miss
Clergy’s years of uselessness were the result of just
such “psychic masquerading” fed by revenge and disappointment.
After all, was this ooze merely confined
to the great? Would they not have to yield a point and
admit they had much in common with their neighbors?</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<p>When she came into the apartment sitting-room, she
found Polly Harris in her shabby brown trappings and
another member of the family whom Polly had dutifully
brought to call.</p>

<p>“It’s Sam Sparling,” Polly announced in boyish fashion.
“Have you seen by the papers he’s to open here
Christmas afternoon? This is Bliss Hobart’s prize,”
waving her hand in Thurley’s direction. “Now beware
of Sam because even duchesses fall in love with him and
he has trunks full of yellowed mash notes—”</p>

<p>Sam interrupted by frowning at Polly and saying,
“Come over here, my dear, don’t be afraid. I’m too
busy to get up a new affair before New Year’s.”</p>

<p>He had the cultured, pleasant voice of a well-bred
Englishman and Thurley could picture his irresistible
methods of love-making, although he was far older than
she fancied and his mouth framed by ironical furrows.
He had really white hair combed into a brisk pompadour,
bright eyes like a young pointer’s and he dressed in
noticeable fashion, with a fine black and white check
suit with exaggerated flares, patent leather boots and
silk shirt and tie matching the suit in pattern. Still, it
was no wonder Sam Sparling could “get across” with
<i>Romeo</i> one day and the next week be giving out an interview
in which he was quoted as remembering the day
Disraeli said to him—!</p>

<p>“What a dear she is!” he remarked to Polly. He
had the habit of talking about a person in front of that
person when he wished to be complimentary or to find<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
fault. “A flapper in a thousand,” putting on gold <i lang="fr">pince-nez</i>
with the foreign straight-across nose-piece which
Thurley had never seen. “By Jove, is Bliss sure she’s
a singer? I could make an actress out of that girl.”</p>

<p>“You’ve not heard her sing,” Polly capered about.
“When she sings, I am inspired to tear up all the opera
scores I’ve fancied were any good and begin again. Because
Thurley has promised me to sing the title rôle
in my opera—now haven’t you?” Polly’s little face was
distressingly in earnest.</p>

<p>Sam shook his head and began talking to Thurley
about Polly. “She is irrepressible, isn’t she? Fancies
she can out-Wagner Wagner—when she is just bound
to end up by writing songs for a ballad singer—one
dressed in sheer muslin with velvet wrist bows—possessing
a thin, carefully tutored soprano that will always
trill certain words.”</p>

<p>Polly picked up a cushion and unceremoniously pitched
it towards him. It fell between Thurley and Sam and
Sam knelt gracefully upon it, adding, “Would that I
could have one of these when I’m trying to look romantic
in this position before a matinée of school girls—ugh,
the old bones do make a howl if I use them carelessly!
Thurley, don’t mind us! You see I’m one of those old-young
boys that just stay old-young to the finish—always
wearing a gardenia in their buttonhole and their
hat tilted rakishly over the left eye. Some day I’ll just
go to sleep and I’ll be toted to the Little Church Around
the Corner with a last gardenia in my buttonhole and I
hope some friend of mine will protest against that awful
firebell embellished funeral march. At least I’m entitled
to have the Faust waltz played—I always have
my greatest luck with stage proposals when that is softly
heard as coming from the supposed supper room of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
hunt ball—and a bill poster without saying, ‘The End
of an Old Beau!’ After it is all over, I hope they’ll
say, ‘Well, Sam never grew old while he was among
us—let’s hope he won’t start the habit now wherever
he’s blown off to!’”</p>

<p>He jumped up as he finished, holding out his hand, and
Thurley took it shyly.</p>

<p>“Don’t mind our nonsense—she’s quite timid, isn’t
she? Reminds me of the way my leading ladies act when
on the stage and when off they rage like a stable boy
if some one happens to cross their notions.” He studied
her a moment longer and remarked, “She is pretty—I
can’t find a single flaw.”</p>

<p>Thurley was pretty that afternoon; perhaps the ooze
had lent her the vivid coloring or it was her bright red
coat with the great silver buttons and the ermine tam
slanting down and showing her dark hair.</p>

<p>“I’m stupid,” she began, “because I’ve been working
so hard.”</p>

<p>Sam settled himself on a sofa to take in the surroundings.
Polly was watching something out of the
window so Thurley took opportunity to remove her
wraps and come to sit sedately beside the famous old
man.</p>

<p>“But I’m not really timid,” she supplemented naïvely,
at which he turned about crying bravo, and threatening
Hobart with losing his prima donna in order that she
become Sam Sparling’s leading lady.</p>

<p>“She’s taking inventory of my wrinkles, Polly,” he
complained, “and my white hair and the wretched old
hump o’ years that has fastened itself on my back.
Bring her to the Christmas matinée and let her see me
in lavender-striped trousers and cutaway coat, the misunderstood
young man turned from his father’s mansion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
returning in the last act to his steam yacht and his second
best Rolls Royce—let her have a go at me and
come behind to have tea afterwards,” he put his hand
down and covered Thurley’s—a thin, tired hand with
prominent, blue veins and a handsome ring of sapphires
on the little finger.</p>

<p>“Haven’t you a good sort of leading woman?” asked
Polly.</p>

<p>“No, the only real bond between us is a mutual love
of Roquefort salad dressing,” he sighed. “Her idea of
art is to be undressed quite halfway down her back and
to fall on my neck in limp giggles.”</p>

<p>“Why do you have her then?” Thurley asked seriously.</p>

<p>“Youth, my child—she is a lovely, young thing, pink
and white, straight, slim, very good to gaze upon—and
she knows it. She can wear a wrap consisting of four
flounces of purple chiffon and a strip of rose satin and
make the audience stare at her impudent, untalented little
self while they <em>listen</em> to my lines! The combination
lets my wrinkles, humped back and cantankerous joints
slip by unheeded. That is a penalty we pay for growing
old. Never mind, Thurley, you’ve years in which to
revel in having both talent and youth—divine combination!”
Sam’s bright eyes grew moody, he was remembering,
as Thurley rightly guessed, the wonderful, golden
years in London when he was Romeo in appearance as
in voice and passion, when he was dark eyed, melancholy
young Hamlet and the critics gently insinuated that as
King Lear he was a trifle youngish although his makeup
was superb! Those were the years when people loved
his Shakespeare because his youth illumined it and he
passed by with proper scorn the smart comedies requiring
a morning garden backdrop, a duel in the library and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
leading ladies who were possessed of more dimples than
brains.</p>

<p>“Why don’t you play old rôles?” Thurley demanded
innocently, Polly smothering a giggle.</p>

<p>“She doesn’t appreciate my romantic little heart and
notions, does she? Let her see me a swashbuckling hero
in hip boots and a green plumed bonnet while my black
charger is led across the stage by bribes of sugar—then
she’ll understand.”</p>

<p>“No, she can’t understand, Sam dear, until she has
reached the matronly age and still wants to do Juliet and
Senta and managers try to show her the error of her
ways—and figure!”</p>

<p>Thurley looked up at her new friend to wonder what
form the ooze took with him. But he good-naturedly
patted her cheek, saying much to her relief:</p>

<p>“I see you are human and not going to ask me to recite
‘Gunga Din.’ I return the compliment by not demanding
that you tear off Tosti’s ‘Good-by.’ I only ran
in to welcome you to our circle and to tell you, as senior
member, a few facts about the others. They will tell
you about me fast enough—”</p>

<p>“Never happy unless he has a breach of promise suit
waiting for him in the morning’s mail,” promptly supplemented
Polly. “Always has it rumored he is to
marry a prominent whiskey dealer’s widow—sells his
mash notes per pound to Caleb, owns a hothouse of
gardenias and has them shipped all over the map—at
heart a flinty old bachelor warrior—a splendid, precious,
cross pal—a jewel of an actor who makes you laugh
and cry as easily as you breathe.”</p>

<p>“There is a young woman,” said Sam calmly, pointing
an accusing finger, “who will never write grand opera—never!
Watch how pale she grows. But she will do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
something heroic, has all the salamander qualities with
none of their viciousness. Would snatch a funeral wreath
right off a door to make a present to some one she loved,
very whippy temperament, believes that bothering over
one’s soul is an emotional luxury, must have had an antique
little romance back somewhere. Where did you
come from, Polly, anyhow? Sort of neighborhood, I
fancy, where the prevailing fashion was to have your
great-aunt’s deceased poodles stuffed and mounted to preside
over dark, chilly parlors.... Of course, Polly
jumped the stockade and landed among us—a forlorn
child with squeaky shoes, as I remember her. She’s as
proud as Punch and stubborn as a bull terrier, so we let
her starve knowing that sometime or other she is going to
bump smack into Fame and he’ll never let go of her.
But not grand opera, Polly girl.”</p>

<p>“I shall stay in New York,” Polly announced, fastening
her coat, “and I shall write a grand opera in which
Thurley shall sing. You will all have to beg my pardon.”
Her brown eyes showed the hurt in them and Sam
Sparling began helping her with refractory buttons of
her wrap.</p>

<p>“I’ll have my apology engraved on a gold scroll and
you can use it for a dinner gong—on the gong handle
will be a bas relief of myself—gardenia and all. So
you can beat me up thrice a day.”</p>

<p>Thurley was laughing; she wondered if Miss Clergy
had napped during the turmoil. “Don’t go,” she
begged. “Please stay a long time.”</p>

<p>“We can’t, we’ve a raft of calls. I always take Polly
because she can break away so neatly. I’m the sort that
sits and sits, ending by halfway swallowing my cane
handle and getting nowhere in particular.”</p>

<p>“Will we really go to the matinée?” she asked Polly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>“Of course. I’ll call for you—and tea in Sam’s
dressing room. Oh, Thurley, you haven’t begun to realize
New York as yet—not Bliss’s New York, but your
New York and mine and Sam’s, too.”</p>

<p>“Why do you love it so?” asked Thurley.</p>

<p>Polly leaned her two by four self against a chair as
she answered, “Oh, because—when I walk down the
Avenue sunny mornings and see ragamuffins sharing an
ice cream cone and visiting British peeresses with their
fresh faces and dowdy clothes vying with our American
heiresses with their smart creations and hunks of black
pearls, when I come upon nice, happy boys and girls from
up state or clever Middle West men here on important
commissions and bronzed cowpunchers and trim naval
officers, to say nothing of portly men of finance bowling
along—I’m New York mad. Besides, when I have
to watch the traffic cops and white baby prams becoming
friendly, to gaze at a window of caramels, mountains of
them, and right next to it to gaze at a window of paintings
on silk guarded by the Pinkertons, when I have to
stop to watch the man in Childs’ turn flapjacks and know
that inside Sherry’s sit the prettiest, best dressed, quite
the most decent men and women in the world nibbling at
tomato surprise and whispering as to how many apartment
houses the waiters own, when I see Pekinese spaniels
airing their new jewelry and mongrels scrapping
over a bone, when I can go to a ten-cent movie or sit
in a box at the opera and wear Ernestine Christian’s
adorable brown velvet dress, when I happen upon
dainty brides buying chintz remnants at Wanamaker’s,
spotting burglars chatting over their prospects at the
Five Points a few moments later—and when I can ride
home sardine fashion in a subway express or take a battered
hansom what ’as seen better days, pin a bunch of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
florist’s seconds to my chest and drift down towards
Washington Square or, once in a while, be picked up
by Caleb or Collin or Ernestine and be glided home in
a motor—well—I love New York,” she paused out of
breath.</p>

<p>Sam bent and kissed her. “Marry me,” he demanded.</p>

<p>Thurley was noticeably embarrassed.</p>

<p>Polly burst out laughing. “That’s Sam’s remedy for
all ills, Thurley. When Ernestine had to move out of
her old apartment, Sam was engaged to her until she was
satisfactorily settled in her new one. It bucked her up
no end.”</p>

<p>Thurley shook her head. “I’m afraid I’ve not come
on enough really to entertain you—do call a year from
now.”</p>

<p>Sam laid his tired hand on her head in mock solemnity.
“Don’t let Hobart cheat you of what you deserve—remember,
every woman has the right to at least one
trousseau!” After which they left, Polly calling back
something as to the time of their meeting on Christmas
afternoon.</p>

<p>Thurley stole to Miss Clergy’s door but the little
ghost lady was fast asleep.</p>

<p>“Every woman has the right to at least one trousseau,”—she
wished he had not said it. She did not want
even deep-down, hidden regrets.... French exercises,
Italian opera scores, singing lessons, English reading selections,
dancing, fencing, horseback, social etiquette,
makeup, costuming, stage directions—pretend, pretend,
<em>pretend</em> things ... and they were trimming the church
at the Corners—Dan and Lorraine this year, Lorraine
with her ring.... What strange people, at odds with
each other and their own selves—what queer, detached
lives—what remarkable theories, fantastically expressed!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
where was the saneness of it, the rhythm—that
was it—the rhythm? Would she experience it and
be satisfied after she had made her bow to the public?
Could the ooze always answer the requirements of her
savage young heart?</p>

<p class="tb">After the Christmas matinée, when Thurley with eyes
as large as saucers, so Polly reported, had watched Sam
play a difficult rôle in superb fashion and had taken tea
with him in his dressing room, she returned alone to
the hotel.</p>

<p>Polly was due at a Greenwich Village affair, Caleb was
with Collin in the country, Ernestine in Chicago practising
scales, as her letter to Thurley would intimate, and
at Birge’s Corners ... ah, that was the ooze, it was
no longer real! So Thurley came into the dingy sitting
room—at least it now seemed dingy—to find that
Miss Clergy had suffered an attack of neuralgia and had
been ordered off to bed. The high tea in Sam’s dressing-room
had robbed her of her appetite, so she did not go
downstairs for dinner but changed her party frock for
a schoolgirl blue serge and stoically settled herself at
her books. She promised herself that after she had diligently
studied she would go into the ooze and celebrate
her real Christmas!</p>

<p>As she put her hand on the table the new bracelet Miss
Clergy had given her that morning struck the wood with
a metallic clink. It was a handsome thing set with diamonds,
handsomer than anything Dan had afforded. But
it had been given her with the generosity of a jailor in
lieu of any one else’s daring to give her such an article!</p>

<p>Thurley began an irregular verb conjugation in sing-song
fashion, fighting off a savage mood. The telephone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
interrupted her and half a second later she was saying
in the gladdest voice she possessed:</p>

<p>“Tell Mr. Hobart to come right up,” hanging up the
receiver and running to the mirror to see just how much
of a fright she looked.</p>

<p>She had no time to think of a change of costume for in
he came, a veritable domestic gentleman muffled in an
ulster, holly in his buttonhole <em>and</em> something in white
tissue paper and tied with red ribbon.</p>

<p>“Merry Christmas! I had five minutes’ extra time
and I thought I’d drop in to take the chance of finding
you. Had an idea you’d be in the doldrums, first Christmas
out of the backyard, y’know.” Unasked, he slipped
off the ulster and Thurley saw he was in evening dress.
“Thing at the club,” he explained, noticing her expression.
“Well, what have we been doing? Don’t tell me
that rascal of a Sam had you behind for tea.”</p>

<p>“He did.” Thurley suddenly found her old wild-rose
self as she told him of the matinée.</p>

<p>When she finished he said, those curious gray eyes of
his narrowing, “A good singer should have a good—”
holding out the white tissue paper parcel.</p>

<p>“Oh, what?” she demanded. “It’s the only present
I’ve had that was done in white tissue paper. Nothing
came from home and the others laugh at Christmas.
Miss Clergy gave me this bracelet—but the bill was in
the box,” she added resentfully. “But this—this is
direct from Santa Claus.”</p>

<p>“It’s a good mascot,” he informed her gravely. “Always
keep it to say little heathen prayers or curses to
and tell it your troubles and your joys. In short, treat
it like a regular fellow.”</p>

<p>Thurley scrambled the paper and ribbon away.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
“Why—I bought you almost the same,” she said unconsciously.</p>

<p>Hobart laughed. “You actually bought your stern
<i lang="it">maestro</i> a present?”</p>

<p>Thurley was absorbed in looking at the little Buddha
carved from lapis lazuli with gold for the features
and diamonds for eyes. “This one is much lovelier,”
she said.</p>

<p>“Tell me—did you really buy me a present?” he
demanded.</p>

<p>She nodded.</p>

<p>“Why haven’t you handed it over?”</p>

<p>“Because—I bought presents for every one—the
sort of things you people laugh at—but you seemed
different from the others so I bought you a Buddha
because I thought you needed some one to tell your real
secrets to—and then, after I wrapped it up, I began to
think you would not like it—”</p>

<p>“Will you get it or shall I send a court order for my
property?”</p>

<p>Thurley vanished, reappearing with the teakwood case.
“Isn’t it odd that we both bought the same thing?”</p>

<p>Hobart’s face was boyish as he took the gift. “Why,
Thurley,” he told her, “I believe I’m training an angel
unawares.”</p>

<p>“You mean me?” she asked humbly.</p>

<p>“What made you speak of telling real secrets?” he
stroked the little idol as he spoke.</p>

<p>“I don’t know—only where do the real things go
to when the unreal have to come first and take up all
one’s time?”</p>

<p>Hobart started towards her; he seemed about to say
something very secret. Thurley looked at him wistfully,
every memory concerning the Corners, her dissatisfactions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
and rebellions vanished. She assumed a gay, star-like
mood.</p>

<p>But he thought better of it and became the polite and
baffling Bliss Hobart with whom no one took liberties,
least of all a girl protégée. It would be wiser to tell the
secrets to the little Buddha whose silence was of golden
quality. Perhaps, if years ago, more years ago than
Thurley knew, one’s secret things had not been used as
public jokes....</p>

<p>“I’m afraid I cannot answer,” he said brusquely.
“Leave my greetings for Miss Clergy and don’t try to
wear your mascot as a watchguard—happy days, to-morrow
as usual.” Patting her on the shoulder, he dismissed
himself.</p>

<p>Thurley set the mascot before her books and returned
to grubbing. Two hours later she glanced up and the
diamond eyes gave her a jolly twinkle.</p>

<p>“I say,” she remarked out loud, “you are first
aid to the agitated! Now tell me—didn’t he for just
a moment treat me as if I were a real <em>woman</em>?”</p>

<p>So passed the first New York Christmas!</p>

<p>The next day, when Thurley went for her lesson, she
had the pleasure of being snubbed and scolded. But
passing out of the studio, she saw the little Buddha sitting
on his desk very close to where his hand must reach
each time he took up his pen or blotted a letter!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>

<p>Ernestine Christian did not return to town until February,
having been induced to play engagements on the
Pacific coast. It was the mid-winter thaw when she arrived.
She telephoned Thurley almost immediately and,
to Thurley’s delight, asked her to come and have coffee
that afternoon as it was a Sunday and lessons were not
a consideration.</p>

<p>“Sure you won’t come along?” Thurley asked Miss
Clergy, dutifully, as she made ready.</p>

<p>“Quite sure, my dear. This wind would start every
bone aching to perdition,” Miss Clergy told her, “and
do put on a prettier dress—there may be guests.”</p>

<p>Thurley looked at her proverbial blue serge with hesitation.
“Oh, I can’t bother to be done up in a real
creation—we’ve such loads to talk over and Ernestine’s
clothes are the sort one never really notices and yet,
describing them as detached things, they are quite wonderful.
Do you think I ought to change?” for it suggested
itself to her that Bliss Hobart might drop in for
greetings.</p>

<p>“I should. You can’t be too particular, Thurley.
The time is coming when the world will want to know
what sort of frocks you wear every clock stroke of the
day.” Here Miss Clergy yawned and settled back
among innumerable cushions and Thurley spied the cover
of a popular novel—one of Caleb’s, to make it the more
amusing—peeping forth.</p>

<p>“Well, if I must—I must,” she said, darting into her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
room and donning a tea-green velour with wee fur buttons
up to the arctic verge of her pink ears. She
wrapped a mantle of green around herself in careless,
becoming fashion, kissed Miss Clergy somewhere between
the chin and forehead and left her to revel in
Caleb’s self-starting romance in which a homely hero was
quite the mode.</p>

<p>She found Ernestine walking about her salon with
Silver Heels perched cordially on her shoulder, purring
for joy at his mistress’ return. Ernestine was busy telling
the maid wherein she had neglected to carry out orders
and why the decorators would be recalled to make
amends. There was a pettish air about her criticisms,
Thurley thought, for when Thurley came in with wide
opened arms, Ernestine merely gave her a shoulder pat,
saying,</p>

<p>“Don’t try to visit until I’ve finished my anvil chorus.
On Caleb’s recommendation I had a firm do things for
me—gaze at the fiasco. It is terribly disquieting to
leave one’s place as one likes it and return to find it the
back parlor of a flourishing merchant!”</p>

<p>“Oh, but it doesn’t look so!” Thurley defended.
“That fire screen is a joy.”</p>

<p>“It may as well be put away,” Ernestine told the maid.
“There’ll be a charity kettle-drum soon enough and
I’ll have to donate something for the raffle. That will
do nicely. Every one wants things one has worn or
used—I’ve a notion the next time to send my last quarter’s
telephone directory—I don’t doubt but what it
would actually be bid for ... there, Agnes, get hold
of the firm early in the morning and don’t call me. You
know what is wrong and I cannot personally stand a battle
with interior decorators. Come inside, Thurley; take
off your green riding-hood cloak and let me see you.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
Ah, lovely, lovely!” she caressed the gown as Thurley
would have wished to be caressed herself. “Why, you
have promoted yourself famously—the hair is charming,
not a hint of Birge’s Corners left! Nice child, how
proud we shall all be—go ’way, Silver Heels, I’ve a new
playmate—shall we stay in my room and pray heaven
no one interrupts us? I ordered black coffee and crullers
so we can be extra wild. Tell me all you have seen
and done.”</p>

<p>Ernestine threw herself on a chaise longue gracefully—she
had a perfect way of doing everything. Caleb
had declared her to be the only woman who could really
look fetching while done up in curl papers! As she lay
there in her negligee of skillfully blended blue and gray
chiffon without a hint of lace to relieve the sulky loveliness
of the colors, Thurley experienced the same shyness
she had that first day in Bliss Hobart’s studio.</p>

<p>“Did your concerts go well?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Do you want these cushions piled on top of you and
myself acting as paperweight on top of them?” Ernestine
raised herself on one thin arm. “<i lang="fr">Continuez!</i> Why not
ask if unknown admirers sent me red, red roses or if I
played Chaminade for the Benevolent Newsboys’ Association
when I was their honor guest—ask if I climbed
Mt. McKinley or was lost in Death Valley—you disappointing
<em>midge</em>, your looks belie you utterly.”</p>

<p>“What is the popular topic?” Thurley was capable
of teasing, too. “Caleb Patmore?”</p>

<p>Ernestine’s sallow cheeks flushed. She made a clucking
noise which brought Silver Heels from under the
lounge. “I hope you eat so many frosted crullers you’ll
take on weight, bringing Bliss’s wrath on your impudent
shoulders. I want to know about you—whom have you
met?—how is the ghost-lady?—the voice of gold—what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
do you think of us now? Sorry you came?” She
laughed over at Thurley in friendly fashion and the
fagged artist vanished.</p>

<p>So Thurley, while February slush-rain beat in vain at
windows and raw winds mercilessly blew, told Ernestine
all that had happened from the time they said good-by in
December.</p>

<p>“I did hate you when you wrote so about Christmas.
That wasn’t fair. Why couldn’t you have let me have
that last bromidic holiday?”</p>

<p>“My child, I cannot endure Christmas and birthday
things. I can stand Valentine’s Day much easier. I
don’t know—but I’m so weary playing holiday
matinées and having the audience one glitter of new
watches, bracelets and other trifling remembrances, of
having their minds groggy from too much dinner and
demanding me to play carols with tumity-tum tunes while
my piano must be holly decorated. Rather prejudiced
me. And birthdays are devil days since they remind me
I never wanted to be born, yet some unknown law of
rhythm would have it so. Here I am, earthbound in a
sallow, fleshy envelope when I’d love to be cloud free
to drift here, there, without restraint, creed, convention—or
the greed for crullers,” helping herself to a second.
“Perhaps it was rough on a new little beggar,
smashing up her bandbox ideas. Never mind, I thought
of you—run open the second drawer of that white chest
and find the jeweller’s box—it is for you. See if you
like it.”</p>

<p>Thurley obeyed, coming back to her chair to examine
the box. “How good you are!” she said, as she came
upon a little blue leather and gold faced clock not much
bigger than a revenue stamp.</p>

<p>“A practice clock when you go on deadly tours.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
Tuck it in your bag as a memento and years hence you
can say, ‘Ernestine Christian—rest her bones for they
seldom rested when I knew her—gave it to me in my
salad days.’ One can always use such trifles. That reminds
me, I have a beaver jacket Polly may be induced to
accept; write ‘Polly—jacket’ on that pad so I’ll remember.
I’ll hunt her up to-morrow. Caleb says she
has been doing supe work in the movies; tough luck for
any one but Polly. But I’ve no doubt she fancies it gains
inspiration for her for the America opera.</p>

<p>“So! Bliss says a nice word occasionally and you
like Sam Sparling—one of God’s own, Thurley—now
<em>he</em> believes in Santa Claus. And you think Collin Patmore’s
pictures superb? Wait until you see his house—Parva
Sed Apta he has named it—and his garden!
There is a fierce rivalry between Collin’s garden and
Caleb’s and likewise their houses. Collin dubs his a
château and I think Caleb claims his is a really true
lodge! Funny boys! We’ll go up there in the summer
and see for ourselves. Oh, yes, Thurley, tell me about
Miss Clergy! I want to ask her if I may take you
abroad this summer; three months across would do wonders
for you. Bliss mentioned it before I went away.
I want to see your eyes the first time you gaze at the
Alhambra in the moonlight. We’ll give Italy half our
time, a few weeks in Paris and six days in London.
You’ll return not knowing yourself.”</p>

<p>“But the money? When, oh, when can I earn?”
Thurley asked in distress.</p>

<p>“Don’t bother about money; just let me tell you what
to pack and what to leave behind. Collin goes to sketch
near Barcelona and we may take the same steamer over—wouldn’t
that be a lark? Collin is the nicest courier
I know, besides being the greatest portrait painter. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
suppose he will give his next season’s subjects Spanish
coloring and a red rose just tumbling off their left ear à
la Carmen. One year he did Russia and I vow every
western society woman he painted had the mysterious air
of stilettos concealed in fans and poisoned cigarettes
that Moscow alone can impart. He’ll run out of countries
by and by, as France, Italy and England are old
stories.”</p>

<p>“Can’t he paint people just as they are?”</p>

<p>“That’s the trouble. He would if he was not careful
to have a supply of ‘atmosphere’ to shoot into muddy
complexions and wriggling noses and to blur softly over
deep-seated moles and other excess facial baggage. I am
the only woman he ever painted without thought for future
commissions.”</p>

<p>“Did he ever paint Mr. Hobart?” she wondered if
she betrayed a blush.</p>

<p>“Haven’t you seen? But, then, you’ve never been at
Parva Sed Apta. It was Bliss’s portrait that gave Collin
his sudden rise. When you look at it, you will understand.”
Ernestine fell to telling of Sam Sparling’s
early stage days and her own début when she actually
had worn white net with pearls, following by a dissertation
on Polly’s angelic stubbornness and hopelessness and
on how she planned to snub Caleb if he wrote a sequel
to “Victorious Victoria” and advice about the attitude
Thurley had best take towards her future associates at
the opera house.</p>

<p>“Won’t we be terribly intimate?” she asked in surprise.</p>

<p>“Dear, no! Oh, you’ll have pictures taken together
in loving attitudes, go to parties and all that—send each
other flowers at proper times. But you’ll never be like
the ‘family’ towards each other and, when you are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
older, you will realize the singular honor it has been to
become one of the family so readily. You may loathe
the tenor who sings <i>Romeo</i> to your <i>Juliet</i> and the woman
who is leading contralto may be a deadly enemy—but
that matters nothing. You sing your rôle and leave it
and your art personality behind in your dressing-room.
You will find that the others also have their own affairs,
interests and opinions. They are not keen for the advent
of a new, charming <i lang="it">diva</i> of whom they are certain to be
jealous and angry of success so swiftly, easily achieved.
You are a musical phenomenon, Thurley, and, as there
are not many in any one generation, you must be guided
accordingly.”</p>

<p>“Please tell me how the ‘family’ started.” Thurley
had not yet reached the stage where talking of herself
and her accomplishments was of keen interest.</p>

<p>“It was Bliss’s idea,” Ernestine paused as if undecided
how much to tell. “He is a rare soul—the jewel
in the toad’s head, we call him. But he wears an armor
of worldly practicability and cynicism; he must be very
sure of one before he lets one know the real man....
Some years ago, when his opinions were just beginning
to find favor, he met Sam Sparling and they had a fearful
row—terrific—Sam said Bliss Hobart was all sorts
of a fool and, after they had it out, they found that each
meant the same thing when you sifted it down to the
makings. So they were comrades. They were together
quite a lot because Sam had him put on plays and then
Sam went to London and Bliss into the opera and music
field.” Here she paused again. “Anyway, they had
really started the family—and when Bliss had a letter
from Sam about Collin Hedley, an American starving in
London, whom Sam was sending back to New York to
paint Bliss’s portrait, he prepared to welcome this Collin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
as a brother, and so he did. The great picture was
painted and Collin was made. Now Collin and Caleb
came from the same little Middle West town and, lo and
behold, up turns Caleb fresh from a fifteen-dollar-a-week
newspaper job and keen as mustard for writing
‘big stuff.’ Inspired by Bliss’s picture and by Bliss and
the whole outlay of atmosphere into which they led him,
Caleb wrote his first best seller—it had heart in it, too—and
although Bliss and Collin wanted to duck him
in the rain barrel for degrading his talent, they loved him
for himself and he joined them. Then, enter Ernestine
Christian! Now this was funny—I was playing London
concerts then and I met Sam: he recited at a royal
benefit at which I played. We sat out between the
numbers talking about ‘what I like to eat’ and ‘what
you like to eat’ and ‘what color you like best’ and
‘what color I like best’ and so on, you know, the usual
procedure. And when I sailed for America I had a
letter of introduction to the trio—”</p>

<p>Thurley finished the confession. “Then they all met
and loved you in different ways.”</p>

<p>“Tell me how?”</p>

<p>“Bliss as a comrade and Collin as a big sister and
Caleb as a real man loves a real woman.”</p>

<p>“You’ve grown up, Thurley,” was Ernestine’s comment.
“But I must tell you that little Polly was added
quite unexpectedly. She was posing as a sprite for Collin;
you know Collin does children’s portraits with pastel
backgrounds of favorite fairy tales, half indistinct—very
good idea and quite the rage. Polly is an ideal
sprite, brownie or gnome model and Collin had run across
her by accident. The first morning she posed she fainted
dead away—slam bang—on the floor, and it was a real
faint because she hadn’t had a square meal in two days,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
just samples of cereals and Hudson River elixir. They
discovered her fierce pride and her tragic ambition and
her adorable self, so she has been our Polly ever
since—”</p>

<p>“Loving Collin—”</p>

<p>“Loving Collin, woman of the world,” repeated
Ernestine. “Then Polly blew in one night in her
audacious fashion accompanied by Mark Wirth. Now
we had seen Mark dance and enjoyed him but knew him
to be a will o’ the wisp person and Lissa Dagmar, who
I hope stays in Paris for all time, had bewitched him and
we really don’t approve of that kind of thing. Mark,
however, was like the foundling in a basket, crying feebly
during the stormy night, and we just could not turn him
away although Lissa tried her best to make inroads into
our ‘family.’ She cried and bribed and writhed because
she still remained aloof from the charmed circle. And
we kept Mark and made him one of us, scolding him
roundly every chance we had.”</p>

<p>“And now I am the infant,” said Thurley slowly, “but
why don’t you like Madame Dagmar?” recalling the
purring voice she had once heard.</p>

<p>“She is impossible—a large person dressed fantastically
in sort of medieval patterns; she has Titian hair and
serpent green eyes, those heavy, white lids in which
purplish veins spread in profusion, and a wretched
voice with the unexplained phenomenon of being able
to reach a tiptop note far above the range of any other
soprano in the world. This one note is as soft and clear
as if it were heaven-sent. It has made her a name and
a fortune, the one divine sound coming as a reward for
poor technique and wobbly trills. She tried opera, failed
miserably, and does concert tours where people crowd to
see her gowns and wait for that tree-top call. The rest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
of the time she gives singing lessons. We call her the
‘Voice Assassin,’ and Bliss Hobart threatens to appeal
to the authorities if she does not take down her shingle.
Ten dollars for twenty minutes and nothing of value to
the pupil save seeing and hearing what is wisest to avoid!
However, like many impossible persons, she has a following,
a personality—a—a—way with her. She
will pet and coo over you, if Mark does not, and you
had best be outwardly polite; it is wisest thus, paying
no heed to her since Lissa proceeds on the principle of
‘what he thought he might require, he went and took
the same as me.’ To Lissa playfulness always means
experience, although the other fellow may not know it!
And then—”</p>

<p>“Madame Dagmar, Mr. Mark Wirth,” the maid announced.</p>

<p>Ernestine sank back among the cushions, groaning.
“I cannot be a low order of animal life and refuse to see
her—she has just returned from Paris, I presume ...
oh, Thurley, help me up! Say we’ll be in,” she told the
maid, staggering to her feet with an exaggerated gesture.</p>

<p>Surpressing a very genuine giggle, Thurley followed
Ernestine into the drawing room where they met an
effusive person wearing a hat which expressed all the best
ideas of the Wright brothers and a gown of shimmering
mauve with gaudy peacock embroideries.</p>

<p>“My sweet children,” Lissa began in her cloying
voice, “to think I find you both here ... and this is
Thurley? What a dear! I know all about you, because
Mr. Hobart speaks of no one else with the same enthusiasm.
Of course I never hope to be called in as a
consulting teacher—dear no,” here she gave a snarly
little laugh, “I’m considered a real villainness by certain
persons. But I shall be fairy godmother anyway—there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
always is an unasked fairy at the christening, you
remember! This is Mark Wirth—” a sweep of her
white, jewelled hand intimated the handsome chap with
burnished gold hair and eyes as blue as Thurley’s. Two
things about Mark saved him from being merely an
Adonis—his long forehead, the forehead of a man who
often complains of being persecuted because of his
tenacity to prove his point, and the astute expression of
his eyes.</p>

<p>“Sit down, every one. I am just back from tour myself—well,
what are your hopes and fears?”</p>

<p>Ernestine let Lissa take the center of the stage.</p>

<p>“Mark isn’t going on tour, I can’t spare him,” here
another snarly laugh. Thurley fancied Mark Wirth
flushed with annoyance.</p>

<p>“Oh, Mark, when you have such bully chances!”
Ernestine protested.</p>

<p>“I can stay in town as well—do let’s talk of some
one else,” he said.</p>

<p>“I want Mark to stop Grecian dancing, there is no
definite future in it now débutantes have taken it up”—her
artificially shaped eyebrows lifting as a danger signal—“and
make a specialty of ballroom dancing—”</p>

<p>Ernestine held up her hand. “God forbid,” she said
reverently. “I saw Mark dance in the Harvard
Stadium—please let him continue to use his brains as
well as his feet.”</p>

<p>“There’s room for a difference of opinion. For
myself, my classes promise to be large this season—and
I’ve wonderful frocks. I’ve reopened the Hotel Particular
and tried to get Collin or Caleb on the ’phone
but their men say they are not about. I only saw Bliss
by accident,” she gave a side glance at Thurley, “it was
then I learned about you!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<p>“Is the Hotel Particular as smart as ever?” Ernestine
hastened to ask.</p>

<p>“I’ve had no end of things done to it. Come and
see. Which you never do. Isn’t it strange, Miss Precore,
I pay five calls to this person’s begrudged one?”
and Lissa smiled in her most disagreeable fashion.</p>

<p>Ernestine tried to smooth over the accusation by praising
Lissa’s frock.</p>

<p>“Mark played rouge-et-noir at Monte Carlo and I
won a winter’s wardrobe,” Lissa boasted.</p>

<p>Ernestine rose and ordered fresh coffee. She was
embarrassed that Thurley must meet the first real scandal
in her house, not but what she would and must meet
many such and not that it shocked Ernestine for she had
always been indifferent to such situations. But latent
motherhood pricked through the armor of indifference.
She began in an extremely spirited manner to talk of things
to which the answers could be anything but personal.
She directly engaged Lissa in conversation, leaving Mark
free to drift over towards Thurley. Within a few moments
they began laughing over some nonsense, to Lissa’s
annoyance, in the same spirit with which Thurley and
Dan had one time laughed—at least two lifetimes
ago!</p>

<p>Mark sat on a straddle chair before her to admire
her wild-rose coloring, contrasting it with Lissa’s well
rouged cheek. He liked Thurley’s green frock which
brought out the whiteness of her skin and the glorious,
deep sea eyes, purple in the winter’s afternoon light.
Presently this embryo prima donna and the famous
dancer, who for the time being mistook shadow for substance,
found themselves discussing juvenile sports which
both really had rebelled at leaving behind.</p>

<p>“You skate? So do I—let’s go incog—I’ll wear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
a mustache—there is certain to be a crowd if we’re
known,” Lissa heard Mark saying.</p>

<p>“ ... and in summer I can play five sets of tennis—and
dance half the night,” Thurley made answer.</p>

<p>“Splendid—Collin has a wonderful court, I want to
take you up there—”</p>

<p>Lissa’s pink lips were thin and shrewd. “Come,
dear,” she said to Mark in her softest voice, “the little
girl will be hoarse to-morrow if you keep her chattering
like a magpie.”</p>

<p>And Thurley, as Ernestine told Hobart afterwards,
sank in her first feminine harpoon! She rose as obediently
as if she were but half her age, saying,</p>

<p>“We can plan about it later, your <em>aunt</em> is calling
you!”</p>

<p>After which Lissa, snarls and purrs all in one, and
Mark more confused and brief in his farewells than
Ernestine had ever seen him, made an inharmonious
exit. And Ernestine kissed Thurley and twirled her
about, saying, “Oh beautiful—beautiful—<em>beautiful</em>!”</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>

<p>Like all clever women who have met defeat often
enough to escape it in the future, Lissa realized the best
way to vanquish an enemy was to know her intimately.
Therefore, she invited Thurley to dinner at the Hotel
Particular. The pink card looked very innocent as Thurley
read in Lissa’s exaggerated handwriting,</p>

<p>“I’ve asked no one else, dear child, because I want
really to know you. And I shall not take no for an answer—I’ll
come and get you if you don’t appear at the
stroke of seven.”</p>

<p>Thurley showed the card to Bliss Hobart before they
began their lesson, watching his brows draw together in
quick alarm and then lift cynically. He threw it aside
with an annoyed gesture.</p>

<p>“I don’t like Lissa’s trying to bag my game, but
you’ll have to go, I suppose, and be done with it. Please
don’t absorb any of her silly notions. You’ve been
brought up so far as any nice child would be and you are
not spoiled. You could be very easily spoiled, Thurley,
and a frightful person if you were. Some persons have
single- and some multiple-compartment minds. That is
why a single-compartment-minded person may have a
tragic experience and it proves the end of him, whereas
a multiple-compartment-minded person emerges unscathed,
to all appearances, only a part of him harmed.
The single-compartment-minded person can comprehend
but one viewpoint, good or bad, one aim, believe in but
one result—if it is good, all is well—if it is bad—disaster,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
hopeless and lasting. You have forgotten
Birge’s Corners too quickly, Thurley, to make me fear
you are of the single-compartment variety. But, please,
take everything Lissa says with a large punctuation of
mental salt and try to wastebasket her entire influence.”</p>

<p>Thurley laughed. “What I planned to do, for I do
not like her and I do like Mark Wirth. Yet she interests
me. Besides, I must know some bad people!”</p>

<p>Hobart shook his head. “If only you never need to—heigho,
here we go, talking against time—”</p>

<p>“Tell me, does Mark Wirth really love her?” Thurley
insisted. She had grown to feel more at home with
Hobart than she had fancied could occur; even during
his abrupt, aloof moments she sensed the gentler part of
him as being merely sidetracked for the time being.</p>

<p>“Mark,” said Hobart as he sat at the piano, “is a
case of the old warning, ‘Vices first abhorred, next endured,
last embraced.’ That is why I beg you to make
your visits to the Hotel Particular far between and few.”</p>

<p>“But sometime he will love some one and then he’ll
find himself,” Thurley concluded. “Can he go on
dancing attendance on a silly old woman who wants
him to sacrifice his art to be a professional ballroom
dancer?”</p>

<p>“You are here for a singing lesson,” Hobart tried
to argue, “but, as you are on the subject, suppose you
suggest that thought to Mark, if you ever have a moment
alone with him. Don’t tell him if there is a door
ajar—unless you look into the next room first. Lissa
is the eternal vigilante when it comes to Mark. Bah, it
is all bad tasting, let’s sing some ballads to get the very
idea out of our heads.” He began, “Hark, hark, the
lark” which Thurley sang—and as she sang it to him,
she did it exquisitely.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<p>As she finished, he asked, “You and Lady Sensible
are good pals, are you not?”</p>

<p>“You mean Ernestine? Oh, yes, I love her,” Thurley
began rapturously, “even when she is at her meanest.”</p>

<p>“Bravo! I will tell you something. Lady Sensible
is a great artist, none greater in her way, but if she
would buy Christmas presents for cross singing teachers
and halfway cry when she thought cross teachers had
bought nothing for her, if she would be unbecomingly
rosy when she took tea with a certain old actor and jump
right up and down and say, ‘Oh—Oh!’ when she saw
Collin’s latest portrait, also sitting up half the night to
read that rascal Caleb’s latest novel, although she knows
it to be worthless—I think Lady Sensible could play
lullabies that would give women the patience of eternity
and girls the thrill of expectant motherhood and inspire
men on to the heights. Don’t tell her I say this
for I have already tried to argue it out with her, but
she fights me back with her desiccated logic! But, Thurley,
do you keep your childish appreciation of things and
that adorable intuition—then all the world will go
a-hunting laurel wreaths for you!”</p>

<p>He bent and kissed her forehead, pushing her away
from him and concluding, “Off with you—I warrant
you haven’t opened a French book to-day. And you have
actually made me sentimental! But when you are both a
real artist and a real girl, I shall tell you a wonderful
secret—now, am I such a tyrant?” He waved his
hand at her until she unwillingly disappeared.</p>

<p>Outside the door Thurley began to smile and the secretary
and stenographer caught its contagion and smiled at
each other as Thurley passed ahead. The elevator man
and the doorman both felt unquestionably chirked up as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
she gazed at them. Every regret or loneliness or jealous
thought concerning the Corners had vanished. She felt
sacred, set apart from every one and she would only share
the reason with a lapis lazuli idol with a painted gold
mouth and very twinkling diamond eyes!</p>

<p class="tb">Thurley’s visit to the Hotel Particular, Lissa’s box of
a place, left her with the belief there never was any end
to surprises. She had worn a white silk dress, falling
straight from the shoulders, flattering herself that for a
dinner with a middle-aged singing teacher she was properly
costumed.</p>

<p>But when she came into the house, she saw her error.
For here she encountered elegance at home. The drawing-room
had the intimate charm of a French salon
with its old ivory and dull blue brocaded hangings. The
furniture was painted peacock blue and covered with rose
taffeta with a silver sheen and a solemn, stuffed parrot
on a gaily painted stand looked at her in cynical amusement.</p>

<p>All about the room, which was oppressively perfumed
as well, were numerous photographs of Lissa taken at
various ages and of handsome men, young, old, middle-aged
and all of them autographed with superlative sentiments
to, “Lissa Dearest” or “Dear Girl Lissa” or
“Adorable Madame Dagmar”! During her moment
of waiting Thurley tiptoed about to read the inscriptions.</p>

<p>There were several of Mark of decidedly more recent
date, some in his dancing attire and others in evening
dress; these were inscribed, “To Lissa, Best Pal Ever,”
and in corresponding vein and as Thurley’s blue eyes
stared at the firm writing, she wondered if it was right
for a man with such a mind as Mark’s merely to dance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
through life and leave a trail of battered hearts behind
him!</p>

<p>There was a lack of books in the room or trifles indicating
pronounced tastes in any subject. The truth was
that the only battles of life which Lissa considered were
worth fighting were those against her double chin and,
beyond handsome editions bound to match handsome sofa
pillows, she gave no thought to the printed page.</p>

<p>Even the piano seemed displeasing in its peacock blue
frame with leopard skin rugs spread fantastically before
the blue and gold bench. Thurley read the titles of the
music on the rack. She had a suspicion she would find
cloying, East Indian love songs or French chansons with
small <i lang="fr">raison d’être</i>, and she was smiling at having been
so utterly correct when Lissa swept into the room in a
striking cherry red velvet with a complete armor of jet
jewelry, saying in affected fashion,</p>

<p>“What is the little one thinking about? Do you like
those songs? Or don’t they let you have a go at them?
I imagine your layout is as heavy as a boiled English
pudding!”</p>

<p>Rather confused, Thurley nodded.</p>

<p>“How larky to have you alone! I suppose you had
to steal away to me.” She stroked Thurley’s cheek and
the girl winced under the soft, sure touch, too practised,
suggestive of a claw beneath the velvety fingers.</p>

<p>“It is so pleasant to come, Madame Dagmar—”</p>

<p>“Madame? Lissa! I insist! Why, I’m not your
grandmother, silly sweet, years do not matter in our
world! What have those disgruntled persons tried to
tell you?”</p>

<p>A gong sounded the dinner hour and Lissa led her into
a fantastic dining-room where a table groaned under
unwholesome goodies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>

<p>“Don’t mention banting,” Lissa said, sitting down unceremoniously,
reaching for anchovies and caviar. “I
adore eating. I don’t believe in denying oneself any of
the good things of life. Come, Thurley, pretend you
are at home, wherever that is, and have a schoolgirl
feast of it. The desserts will be poor because cook
is so involved in a breach of promise suit.” With small
regard for etiquette, Lissa was “wading in,” as Dan
Birge would have said.</p>

<p>Thurley contrasted it with the “family” dinner parties
where food was merely the medium of their getting
together; where every one talked first and ate last. Not
so with Lissa; she had a quick, untidy way of swallowing
her food and talking while she did so; she spotted her
bodice in revolting fashion, dabbing at the stain with
her napkin and saying she ought to be sent to bed!</p>

<p>In fact, Lissa had little time to talk to Thurley until
the café noir was served in the salon. Then, uncomfortable
from the six-course dinner to which she had done
full justice, now dipping into a box of puffy chocolates
with nut centers and taking absinthe with practised sips,
she turned her rather fleshy face towards Thurley and remarked,</p>

<p>“You know, the only way I remember places in Europe
is by the things we had to eat at them! Take
Stratford-on-Avon, for instance, I always appear animated
when it is mentioned, but not because of the
Hathaway woman or Bill Shakespeare, but the wonderful
gooseberry tarts ... then Rome—what cheese!
And Moscow—with its caviar and cordials—and
Amsterdam with boiled beef and a delectable shrimp
sauce,” she halfway closed her eyes as she sipped the rest
of her absinthe and rebuked Thurley for refusing it.</p>

<p>“Perhaps you smoke?” she suggested. “My throat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
won’t stand for it and I take sweets as a consolation.”</p>

<p>“No, thank you—at least not yet.” Thurley wondered
if she would ever cease meeting famous persons and
going to wonderful houses where she had an entirely
new scheme of life handed to her stamped with a seal
of approval!</p>

<p>“Do have a chocolate,” Lissa pressed them on Thurley.
She had a sort of, “May I—oh, <em>may</em> I?” air
which Dickens’ Mr. Pumblechook possessed when asking
for the pleasure of merely shaking hands.</p>

<p>Thurley took one but laid it aside. “Mr. Hobart
forbids it,” she said.</p>

<p>Lissa made a little moue. “The world does not obey
Bliss Hobart, even if it does consult him. For my part,
we are cordial enemies, both knowing the other’s weak
points. After all, Bliss was never cut out for anything
more extraordinary than a first husband. But of course
he will never marry,” the green eyes watching Thurley
carefully.</p>

<p>“Why not?” Thurley was unconscious of her betrayal.</p>

<p>Lissa gave a contented purr; she would have something
to tell Mark! “Because, although no one really
knows much about it, he disappears very mysteriously
every summer for weeks at a time. He cannot be
reached by letter or telegraph, I’ve heard, and of course,
in this day and age, as in any other, he does not go
alone.”</p>

<p>“Not—not that sort of thing,” Thurley was too
angry to conceal the fact.</p>

<p>“Why not? Every one knows that Bliss Hobart,
whose mother was an Italian and father an American,
was born and brought up in Italy where he acquired the
romantic tendencies of that land. Some say he sang
well when he was twenty, but something happened and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
he had a fever which took his voice and turned his hair
gray and then he came to America where he has
been a clever but presuming person with the aroma of
mystery to make him all the more enticing. You will
find out, Thurley; wait until he vanishes around the first
of June.”</p>

<p>“Of course the family knows where he goes.” Thurley
spoke the name before she thought; it brought sharp,
black lights into the green eyes.</p>

<p>“That ridiculous family, so reserved and exclusive,
they bore me! Well, not even being the family skeleton,
I can’t say, but I fancy they know little. Now you
take such a conceited, haughty person as Ernestine Christian
or that stupid Caleb or Collin with his childish, impossible
manners or that queer little wisp—Polly something—”</p>

<p>“But you forget I am the baby of the family,” Thurley
reminded.</p>

<p>“A thousand pardons. My dear, I did not mean to
offend. Of course I have my own circle, too. I am
welcome in the best homes in France and England and
I am always being taken for a marquise. I have my own
theories about art and quite as much of a clientele as
these fossils you have been bundled into without a warning.
Don’t let them monopolize you with their nunnish,
strange ideas—so utterly loveless—”</p>

<p>“But I have promised never to marry,” Thurley interrupted.</p>

<p>Lissa laughed. “Artists seldom have the hen spirit!
For myself, I am always more interested in a second
wedding than a first, and if the first is only to tell you
what to avoid in the second, why have the first?”</p>

<p>“But—” began Thurley rather helplessly.</p>

<p>“For a second wedding I always see myself in a gown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
of gold brocade and a blond veil, both guiltless of trimming.”
Lissa’s eyes strayed toward a photograph of
Mark which stood on a nearby gilt table.</p>

<p>“But—it isn’t right, you know, to—” Thurley was
naught but a huge gaucherie.</p>

<p>Lissa threw back her head to laugh, her plump white
chin quivering after the soft sound ceased. Absinthe
brought about freedom of speech—and liberty for all!
“A fig for man-made laws! Don’t you know laws are
made for the mass? Are you one of them? You know
you are not or you would not have a fairybook life,
coming to New York to be trained by Bliss Hobart!
You may not know it as well as I, but I tell you this
much—I would not ask you to dinner if you were
merely one of the mass. Count me snobbish, if you
like, you’ll be the same. None of us have time for
any one who does not make it worth our while. I was
careful to find out about you before I wrote you the
note—and when you are very famous, perhaps you’ll
write a ‘recommend’ card for me or let me polish off a
song or two; even Bliss admits I can coach!”</p>

<p>She went to a table to find an album, beckoning to
Thurley to join her. “See—here and here—and this
one—aren’t they as famous as your family? Look at
this photo and that autograph, well, what did I tell you?
Don’t become lop-sided, Thurley, or change into a
crabbed spinster. Live and let love come to you—you
are a genius, a super-creature—you have the right to
love as you please!”</p>

<p>“You do believe so?” Thurley fairly whispered the
words. She fancied she had so stolidly locked away
love from her wild-rose heart!</p>

<p>“I know so! The greatest artists have always been
exceptions to the rule, never meek slaves of the law.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
In a clever, vivacious manner, Lissa proceeded to tell
risque stories of this actor and that singer, the pianist
who loved and hated all in a month and loved and hated
again before another fortnight passed, the artist’s model
who became morganatic queen of a small Balkan kingdom
and threw aside her rank to join her worthless, gypsy
lover, dancers who did so and so, the poet and novelist
who had never spoken the word constancy and whose
works the humdrum, constant world accepted with reverent
unquestioning!</p>

<p>As she stood there in her flaring red velvet gown, the
clever lamplight showing the beauty of her hair, perfume
addling Thurley’s brain, the purring, soft voice
never ceasing and the green eyes smiling fixedly, Thurley
began to wonder if it would not be well to be friends
with Lissa, despite Hobart and Ernestine, to know the
other side of the art world—all its phases and possibilities—for
had she not a multiple-compartment mind?</p>

<p>After a little, Lissa drew her to her and they walked
to a tête-à-tête and sat there, Lissa drinking absinthe
and Thurley hearing more strange, wicked but fascinating
things all of which might become realities for herself
and still keep the letter of her vow to Abigail Clergy.</p>

<p>“The greater the artist the more unmoral he must
be, not immoral, that is for the commoner—but unmoral—morals
do not matter. Art is a question of
light and shade, ability, press agents—so on. An artist
cannot achieve if hampered by petty, binding laws and
paltry promises; he must have freedom of thought and
action, see—I make no pretense, Thurley, of being a
Victorian matron,” she pointed to the rows of photographs
all of which were of men.</p>

<p>“I am Lissa Dagmar and society knows and values
me because I dare to be what I am. Society sends me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
its most precious débutantes to take lessons—and some
day, you, too, Thurley, will laugh as I do at these fragile
ideals the world weaves about us people who do things.
The people <em>who have things to do</em> may be nuns and
monks and model married couples, but those <em>who do
things</em>—wait, wait until you meet your opera associates—où,
la-la,” she broke into a French street song ending
with an unexpectedly high note which thrilled Thurley’s
whole being.</p>

<p>“Oh, Lissa Dagmar,” she said, as fascinated as a
country lad with the fair snake charmer, “let me come
to see you again—”</p>

<p>Lissa leaned back in contentment. She had thrown
the spell as she planned—since she had not forgotten
that Thurley had called her Mark Wirth’s aunt! She
was telling more of her scheme of things when Mark
himself dropped in and was, for once, an unwanted
guest.</p>

<p>“I’m awfully glad to see you,” he told Thurley.
“Hobart said you would be here—so I came.” He
avoided Lissa’s eyes. “He said I must bring you home
because he does not like stray cab drivers and he says
you’ve no car of your own. I say, Lissa, I’ve got the
coast engagement and if I have my company ready by the
first of April, we’ll be on our way.”</p>

<p>Lissa mumbled a response. Mark was looking at
Thurley’s half flushed cheeks and startled eyes, the prim
white gown cut high in the neck—a contrast to Lissa’s
sumptuous red velvet which revealed a fifth vertebra!</p>

<p>“Oh, do take me home. I’ve heard such a world of
new things and eaten such a goody shop that I’ll have
hard work to be of any use to-morrow!” It was a
relief to have Mark appear; there was a hint of the
boy Dan in his manner and his handsome self hovering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
about her. She looked at Lissa and enjoyed her discomfiture,
wondering if when she had dissected her
theories she would still believe in them or if there were
not something of the sorceress about Lissa with her purring
voice and velvet-like hands. Then, realizing that
Mark was one of Lissa’s “pet robins,” as she named
him, that he—all the old-time horror which the Corners
had bestowed upon its “nice” girls rushed over her
and she grew monosyllabic and preoccupied as she made
ready to accept his escort.</p>

<p>Lissa kissed her good-night and added, “Drop in on
your way home, Mark, I’ve something to tell you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you want to see me to-night?” His voice was
rather lack-lustre.</p>

<p>As the cab rolled off in the night, Lissa standing at
the glass doors, a striking figure in her crimson gown,
Mark said anxiously,</p>

<p>“What did you talk about? Lissa’s such a rattlebox
when she has had absinthe!”</p>

<p>Thurley answered coldly, “Art,” after which Mark
tried to explain his coming tour but it brought no response
from Thurley. She was trying to decide three
things all at once.</p>

<p>Did she or did she not believe Lissa’s theories?
Should she have a contempt for Mark who evidently did
coincide with them or should she, womanlike, flirt with
him since he seemed most willing? Lastly, where did
Bliss Hobart go to of a summer? Perhaps green lights
showed in Thurley’s eyes as well.</p>

<p>But she would have been still more disillusioned had
she seen Mark an hour later returning to the Hotel
Particular and finding an enraged, ugly woman, harsh-voiced,
red-faced, clad in a pink chiffon negligee with
hideous flounces.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>

<p>“You needn’t think she’ll look at you,” she began accusingly,
pounding her heavy fists on the table. “She is
Hobart’s prize and he is no saint, even if he does have his
playtime where the neighbors can’t see him! How dare
you come in here and take her home—an insult to me,”
letting rage carry her to the top notch of unreason and
unrestraint while Mark, sullen yet anxious to appease,
was forced to watch the entire procedure. Presently he
found opportunity to reply,</p>

<p>“I say, don’t tear it off rough! Have I neglected
you or done anything without your approval? I’ve held
up my best work to please you, because you want to stick
in New York where you have a drag. Don’t you think
that is something? But I’ll do the coast thing if it
means a break,” a determined look replacing the anxious
expression.</p>

<p>Lissa’s eyes narrowed. She saw she had overreached
herself. Cleverly, she began a retreat. “Mark dear,
I’m jealous! I’m not a nice young thing like Thurley—and
you were a naughty bear to drop in and take
her home—leave poor Lissa all aloney. Please, honey,
kiss me; say you love me; you won’t go ’way out to the
coast. I won’t let you. Remember all I’ve given up
for you,” pointing at the photograph of an elderly, well
known man of finance. “I must have love, Mark, and
loyalty—such as I give the one I love.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but not servility—not crushing every bit of
originality and decency from a chap—that girl’s eyes
look you through!”</p>

<p>“Where would you have been if not for me?” Lissa
was holding him half by force. “Who helped you
when you had the fever? Who introduced you to Newport,
who—”</p>

<p>Mark threw off her arm roughly. “Stop! Sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
I wish you’d let me find my own gait in my own
way—maybe it wouldn’t be dancing—”</p>

<p>Lissa burst into effective sobs. “Don’t say you want
to be a horrid old lawyer or sawbones! Why is it so
many wonderful men have loved me, yet I give my heart
to a sulky boy that cannot appreciate what it means—why
is it?” she demanded of the empty absinthe glass.</p>

<p>Mark almost laughed. “I’ll play fair,” he said doggedly,
“but I do the coast tour in April.”</p>

<p>“You’ll grow away from me—”</p>

<p>“Which might be a good thing. I thought you didn’t
want constancy, did you tell Thurley so—try to make
her see your death-in-life stuff?”</p>

<p>“You’ve been drinking!”</p>

<p>“No, you’ve been drinking and I’ve been thinking.
You know, Lissa, it’s well enough to play off a few
weeks of nonsense abroad; something about Monaco and
Florence get into your blood. But, after all, a fellow
must think ahead and so ought a woman. I want to be
the soap-and-water-washed sort I was. Makes me wish
I hadn’t danced a step—had a hammer-toe or a club-foot
so I couldn’t!”</p>

<p>“You’ve been talking to Bliss,” she said sharply.</p>

<p>“He does jerk me up now and then.”</p>

<p>Lissa threw back her head and closed her eyes.
“Have I wasted the finest love of my live on a cad?”
she asked of some unseen presence. “Have I told my
secrets, the secrets of my inner shrine—”</p>

<p>“Not inner shrine,” Mark could not refrain from
adding, “inner shrink!”</p>

<p>Lissa sprang to her feet. “You young idiot,” she
said between set teeth, “you know I’ll not let you go
until I’m ready to—I never do—I’ll show the whole
pack of prudes that I can beat their game—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>

<p>Then the cad in the boy, which is in every boy, came
to the surface and battled for supremacy in his handsome
face right and wrong; he smiled in smug fashion
symbolic of the fact that he had passed up the struggle.</p>

<p>“Maybe I’ve just wanted to see how you cared,” he
suggested. “Got any more of that stuff to drink?”
He sat on the tête-à-tête and, waiting until she poured it
out, let him celebrate the defeat of his better half.
“My word, Thurley has a long road to go!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>

<p>Thurley did not see much of Lissa or Mark for the
next few weeks. Perhaps Lissa deemed it wiser not to
encourage Thurley’s becoming one of her protégées because
of Mark,—at least, until Thurley was a prima
donna and her mind busied with many things. At the
present time Thurley was amenable to all new faces and
suggestions. Had she permitted her to be more with
Mark than was customary who knows but what the result
would spell disaster for Lissa’s contentment. Let Thurley
taste of fame as Lissa had, for a short time, tasted,
and she knew no mere individuals could claim her attention
as they might now.</p>

<p>Neither did Thurley see Sam Sparling nor Ernestine
for they were on tour. Sam sent her a doll, a wonderful,
fluffy-skirted young lady doll with her brown
hair combed modishly, bits of kid gloves reaching to
the dimpled, wax elbows and a paste brilliant necklace.
The accompanying card read, “Thurley Precore, prima
donna, from an old beau!” And when Thurley audaciously
took the doll to Hobart’s studio the next lesson
hour, Hobart pretended to give the lesson to the doll and
not Thurley, saying in conclusion,</p>

<p>“As no one else is here, Thurley, I can lecture you all
I like and say what I really think—how charming you
look in that costume—but please don’t listen to Lissa’s
nonsense, you’ll hear enough of it presently. Kid gloves,
too! I declare if Sam hasn’t lost his old heart—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>

<p>“Why not listen to Lissa?” asked Thurley, imitating
a doll’s shrill voice.</p>

<p>“Because you must choose the straight, narrow path
of hard work and a terrific loneliness of soul if your
success is to be lasting and independent of others. You
may bestow your affections on some one as a gracious
favor—after you have made for yourself your public
place—but never listen to what such women as Lissa
chatter about—or such women as you will meet in the
opera house. You will see them come and go, quickly
appearing and more rapidly disappearing and that is because
they have followed Lissa’s logic.”</p>

<p>“But please,” still imitating the doll’s voice, “what
in the world am I to do? I’ve promised never to marry
any one and I’m sure I won’t love any one I cannot marry.
I’m not keen on slum work and I don’t choose cigarettes
and Persian kitties for my home atmosphere as Ernestine
does—nor attics like Polly.”</p>

<p>Hobart’s face was grave. “Some day, we will talk
about things and I will tell my secrets—but not yet, you
are too young and flushed with dreams.” He stopped
speaking to the doll as he added, “You must tramp
abroad with Ernestine this summer; Miss Clergy may go
or not as she wishes. But when you return you are to
start rehearsals for your début.”</p>

<p>Thurley looked at him for a long, glorious moment.
After all, it had been worth the winter’s work and bewildering
experiences. To make her début—would she
ever forget the day in the stableyard of the Hotel Button
when Dan engaged her to sing at his circus, rival to the
“great swinging man”—and she had told him then that
some day she was to sing before great audiences—maybe
earning as much as a dollar a night!</p>

<p>“I’m not ready,” she began.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>

<p>“You will be—stage directions, a good maid, a press
agent, Santoza’s coaching and a little polishing here and
there. I told you the first day you sang for me that God
had taught you how to sing, man merely teaching you
what.”</p>

<p>“Abroad—London—Paris—Spain—” Thurley
began to whisper. “It’s true—isn’t it?—say that it
is—,” dancing up to him, her eyes like stars.</p>

<p>“Don’t be too happy,” he suggested almost testily,
“I can’t bear to see it!”</p>

<p>“Why not?” she was the aggrieved, wild-rose child
speaking her mind regardless of the person who was
listening. “Because <em>you</em> are not happy?”</p>

<p>“No, because you must find out sooner or later that
each life is given so much happiness, pain, cowardice,
bravery, all attributes and emotions, the same as we
are physically endowed with so much eyesight, hearing,
power of locomotion, and when you realize that and know
that when you burn up all the joy and ecstasy of unthinking
youth, there is nothing, nothing that can ever cause
such joy to exist again or give one such an abandon of
mirth—all the rest of life snails on in gray patterns—I’d
like to have you save your joy for things more worth
while than this, distribute it so it will last through the
gray days, Thurley!”</p>

<p>Looking at him, Thurley saw that his face was a dangerous,
shiny white as if he had been ill a long time
and his eyes were deadish, burnt-out things.</p>

<p>“I am sorry,” she began impulsively, “that you’ve no
joy left—”</p>

<p>Hobart recalled himself and began pointing out errors
in her last song. They did not go beneath the surface
again during the lesson. When it was finished, Hobart
said November would probably be the month of her début,—not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
in “Faust” as she had fondly imagined but as
the vivacious <i>Rosina</i> in “The Barber of Seville”; protest
all she liked, <i>Rosina</i> it was to be.</p>

<p>“That is nearly seven months away,” he said, looking
out at the April sky. “Ernestine writes she will be
home by June and you will start soon after. You must
be back by the middle of September—however, that
gives you quite a holiday. From now on, Thurley, I
shall not see you—” he held out his hand but she did
not seem to notice.</p>

<p>“Where are you going?”</p>

<p>“London, to superintend some pantomime things and
opera. I’ll be back in June but not until you have sailed;
we’ll almost be ships passing in the night. But I’ll be
here in September to hear you tell of the Old World
as seen by two very blue eyes. To-morrow you will
please go to Santoza for coaching. You don’t like him
and he likes no one save his gnarled old self—he has
seen too many women play hob with too many men ever
to like the loveliest of beginners. But he will teach you
all you need to know and Antone will take you for the
singing hour. If Lissa suggests that she coach you,
ward her off. Now, my little prodigy, good-by and a
happy summer.”</p>

<p>Still Thurley did not take his hand. “Where do
you go from June until September?” she demanded.</p>

<p>Hobart neither glowered nor started as she anticipated.
He laughed and patted her shoulder, whispering, “Ah,
that would be telling—”</p>

<p>Some one tapped at his door and Thurley, perforce,
tore herself away.</p>

<p>She would not see Bliss Hobart for nearly seven
months ... seven months ... then she would make
her début! Well, if she could glean from Ernestine bits<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
of her philosophy and from Polly her contagious jollity
and add a trifle of Lissa’s purring loveliness—and she
became as famous as her own voice could make any one—perhaps
even Bliss Hobart might be tempted to say
where he disappeared each year!</p>

<p>Thurley was planning a startling series of events between
herself and Bliss Hobart as she left the building,
trying not to let tears crowd her blue eyes or betray she
was perturbed.... Santoza, hateful ogre with dirty,
yellow hands, absurd, striped clothes and long, greasy
hair, always mumbling to himself in Italian—she must
study with Santoza and have those yellow, soiled fingers
whirl angrily in the air as he tried to explain wherein
she was in error and with Antone, that cynical little dandy
with no more heart than flint, who stared at her through
half-closed lids and only ridiculed, never praised!</p>

<p>Then Thurley resolved a dangerous but very feminine
thing. Had she but known, many other younger and
lovelier women than herself had resolved the same thing
regarding Bliss Hobart. She would make him <em>care</em> for
her! Not even Miss Clergy’s vow should prove an obstacle.
She would make him care ... after that was
an undetermined stage of rapture, a new and alluring
sort of ooze in which to take refuge after hateful hours
with Santoza and Antone and wondering moments as
to what Hobart was doing and where he hid for his
summer holiday! Thurley would make him care. Having
achieved that, she would then employ Lissa’s theories
as a vaulting pole to take her well over the handicap
which Miss Clergy fancied she had forever placed in the
way of romantic love.</p>

<p>No woman had yet succeeded. This Thurley did not
know; like all the others she was sure that she was to
prove the exception.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<p>She worked with Antone and Santoza cultivating an
attitude of indifference to offset their unpleasant personalities.
Miss Clergy, in her squirrel cage of a world,
looked on with pleased but feeble eyes and told Thurley
she must go abroad with Ernestine Christian.</p>

<p>“You’ll come, too?” Thurley begged. “You must
not stay so alone. All you do is to drive and read—and
you do read the same books over and over—and talk
with me a little and sleep a great deal. When I drag
you into a shop you are as timid as can be and you won’t
meet people though I’ve coaxed and begged. Please
come with us—think of France, Spain, Italy,” Thurley
hurried on to produce many new and tempting arguments.</p>

<p>Miss Clergy shook her head. “He came from Italy,”
she said. “I could not bear it.”</p>

<p>Remorseful, undecided what was best to say, Thurley
stood back abashed. “Oh, don’t let it hurt for so long—you’ve
burnt up all your joy,” recalling Hobart’s
words.</p>

<p>Miss Clergy waved Thurley off. “I’ll go to a rest
cure,” she decided. “Now be off, my head is starting
to ache.”</p>

<p>Still Thurley hesitated. “You won’t go back to the
Corners?” she asked.</p>

<p>Miss Clergy gave a cackling laugh. “Don’t worry,
Thurley, I’d not go back even to dance at Dan Birge’s
wedding.”</p>

<p>Thurley left the room. She tried Ernestine’s antidote
for heart stirrings as she practised scales, louder and
louder in more and more glorious a voice until Miss
Clergy fell asleep, happy at heart—for had she not
at the eleventh hour saved a genius from mediocrity and
secured revenge for her withered tragedy?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>

<p>The first Sunday morning in May, Polly Harris appeared
to carry Thurley off, first to her attic to retrieve
something she had forgotten, and next to Collin Hedley’s
garden and château a few miles up the Hudson.</p>

<p>“I knew this wasn’t lesson day and so I was sure you
would come along. Wear something old because Collin’s
place is one of those shabby-elegant affairs where new
costumes seem vulgar. I think the only time when Lissa
is ever uncomfortable is at Collin’s garden parties, but she
has to come because she is jealous of Mark and there she
is, a great, painted doll among real things.”</p>

<p>Polly audaciously danced about Miss Clergy’s rooms
while Thurley hurried into her blue serge with a flat,
black sailor. Polly kept up a pleasing conversation with
Miss Clergy as to Thurley’s début and the proposed trip
abroad, the wonderful things Bliss had been doing in
London and what a jolly world it was anyhow, actually
tucking an extra pillow behind Miss Clergy’s back and
leaving her the last issue of a shocking art journal as her
proper Sabbath reading. Hobart had truly prophesied
that when Polly went to heaven she would be given the
position of keeping every one chirked up when things
promised to be a trifle ponderous.</p>

<p>“Let’s be ordinary critters and fly down to my sky
parlor on a Fifth Avenue ’bus,” she proposed. “I pay
the fares,” jingling her coin purse.</p>

<p>“Oh, no, Polly,” Thurley interposed. Thurley did
not comprehend what Ernestine had tried to impress
so carefully upon her—that Polly was not yet defeated,
that she must be careful lest she hint of the opinions
of the family which were that defeat for Polly was
inevitable.</p>

<p>Polly pursed up her mouth crossly. “Do, Thurley,
this is my party,” she insisted, after which Thurley gave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
way and let Polly spend two precious dimes in lordly
fashion.</p>

<p>As they proceeded down the Avenue, seated on the top
of a Washington Square ’bus and quite as happy as when
Ernestine had taken them out in her motor, Polly said,</p>

<p>“I haven’t had the chance of really doing anything for
you, Thurley—”</p>

<p>“You have, too; there was Sam Sparling—”</p>

<p>“Yes, but no one is like Collin.” Her face was illumined
from within. Thurley’s dramatic sense caught the
wonderful hopelessness of the expression, cold-bloodedly
resolving to copy it in any rôle which should demand a
similar emotion. “Collin is the most wonderful person
in the world, besides being the most wonderful painter.
I’m so glad he asked us out for Sunday. He’d have done
so before but he’s terrifically busy. All the world crowds
his doorstep to be painted. Fancy, Collin has no New
York studio—if people wish his work they must come
to him and come they do. When you see Parva Sed
Apta, you’ll understand why it is the only place in the
world of its kind and how beautiful and good is Collin’s
own self.” Polly was unconscious of her betrayal.</p>

<p>“Is he as wonderful as Bliss Hobart? Ernestine says
Collin painted Mr. Hobart’s portrait and it made him.”</p>

<p>Polly was loath to give up her argument. “Well,
Bliss is wonderful—no one denies that—but in a
different way. There are so many sides to Bliss; one day
he is a hermit, the next a schoolboy, then a stern master,
a diplomat, a sarcastic critic, a taskmaster—sometimes,
very rarely of late, he is a dreamer, as idealistic as the
tints of the skies in Collin’s pictures. But Collin is always
Collin, a child with a talent so huge he does not
comprehend it himself and, therefore, he can never be
spoiled.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span></p>

<p>“Has he never married?” Thurley asked innocently.</p>

<p>“Oh, no,” Polly’s answer was made in breathless
haste, “he never thinks of such a thing—he is absorbed
in work ... why, if one is his friend, it is all one should
expect ... it is enough,” she added bravely.</p>

<p>“Do you think Caleb Patmore will marry?” Thurley
braced her little boots against the front board of the
’bus as they rounded a bump in the pavement.</p>

<p>“Not unless some one makes Ernestine realize she has
a heart tucked away in that austere bosom of hers....
I could beat Ernestine for not loving that boy,” and the
thought of Polly, so tiny and gentle in her brown garb,
and of Ernestine, stately and unapproachable, in some
smoky drapery, made Thurley give way to a chuckle.</p>

<p>“Don’t try it unless you take a course of jiu-jitsu,”
she advised.</p>

<p>But Polly was rambling on in a new vein. “When
Ernestine returns, she will take you to Caleb’s house; then
you’ll see how a famous novelist who has commercialized
himself lives—and you won’t like it! Every June Ernestine
visits Caleb and generally takes me as ballast—sort
of grand duchess conferring a favor, you know.
The rest of the year, unless Caleb entertains, he has to
come to her whenever she will have him, starved of heart,
yet loyal. (Of course if people care they do stay loyal)
... but wait until you see Caleb’s sleek establishment
and contrast it with Collin’s transplanted paradise.”</p>

<p>They jumped off the ’bus steps and made their way
down a narrow side street which was most distressingly
dirty to Thurley’s mind, reaching a dilapidated brownstone-front
house with “Rooms for Rent” in the parlor
windows. Skipping up a fire escape on the outside, with
Thurley toiling after, Polly opened a bit of a window on
the top floor, jumped down inside while the boards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
creaked perilously and then assisted Thurley to do likewise.</p>

<p>“I never go up the inside way unless it is winter,” she
explained, “because every poor devil would stop to ask
for a loan. I can’t refuse unless I’m stony broke and I
can’t afford to part with the little I have. Of course
they can’t pay back, poor dears! So the fire escape affords
an excellent subterfuge and no one’s feelings are
hurt. I want to take Collin a book on woodcuts; I
found it at an old bookstore the other day.” She was
prowling about a dusty secretary, opening drawers and
failing to close them.</p>

<p>Thurley stood in the center of the room aghast at
Polly’s attic. Ernestine and Caleb had prepared her for
it, saying with almost reproach that she, Thurley, was
missing the glorious camaraderie with failures, she was the
proverbial jewel in the rough who was taken to an expert
lapidary, cut, polished and placed in platinum without any
transitional stage! And she would do well to learn more
of Polly’s life so as to glean the atmosphere of optimistic
struggle, humorous cares and sometimes indescribable
pathos. So much Thurley did in the moment she waited
for Polly to find the book—a book costing a week’s
earnings!</p>

<p>The room was badly in need of repair; the roof sloped
down so Thurley had to crouch if she moved but a foot
either way—it reminded her of Betsey Pilrig’s attic.
There was a cot made into a divan with a turkey red
covering and pillows, a scrap of a rag rug, an easel, for
Polly did commercial drawings fairly well, a table one
confusion of doll furniture and china dolls dressed in
wisps of silk, satin and burlap. Polly explained this was
her “tryout”—when she was planning scenes in her
opera, she had the puppets assume positions so as to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
gauge the effect. She was so serious about the matter
that Thurley was forced to conceal a laugh as she said the
idea was excellent.</p>

<p>“I have no typewriter; did have last winter, but I
played in hard luck and left it at ‘uncle’s.’—I scribble
almost as swiftly and so it’s of no consequence,” she added
contentedly. “Just last week I had an idea and I think
it is a real idea, Thurley—as you are to sing the title
rôle I’ll tell it to you. Instead of having <span class="smcapuc">THE</span> American
opera founded on the landing of Columbus and a romance
of an Indian girl with one of his knights and so
on—of course I’ll finish it and have it produced later,”
she supplemented in all seriousness—“I have decided to
do a series of operas dealing with American wars. First,
the Revolution—you are to be Moll Pitcher—then
1812—then the Mexican War—the Civil War—the
Spanish-American—pray heaven there will be no other.
Don’t you see how great it will be—great—<em>great</em>?”
her body swaying with excitement. “Yesterday, I did
two arias.” She fumbled about the secretary and unearthed
music paper covered with startling black notes.
“Oh, Thurley, I must succeed—I must. I won’t take
no from either gods or half-gods. I’ll defy them! I
won’t slink away and become an upstate saleswoman for
victrolas! There!”</p>

<p>“I hope you will,” Thurley said gently.</p>

<p>“You say that as if you’d like to add, ‘Here, my pore
gel, take this quarter and wear a cap the next time you
meet me!’ Wait—wait until you fail.”</p>

<p>Thurley’s spirit was roused. “But I won’t—not in
my work.”</p>

<p>“There are other ways than work—love, for instance?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>

<p>“I won’t fail in love,” the defiant, wild-rose Thurley
was always on hand to meet a challenge.</p>

<p>“Don’t promise yourself everything,” was Polly’s sage
advice, “and now, I believe we are ready to decamp.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>

<p>She found Collin’s place more than Polly said, since
Polly viewed it through adoring eyes and was blind to
tiny flaws.</p>

<p>Their approach was anything but conventional. They
had raced up from the station, Polly winning by a nose,
hilarious young persons with flushed faces.</p>

<p>They found the famous Collin, in an artist’s smock of
gray chambray, sweeping off his front steps! Upon seeing
them, he called out,</p>

<p>“Cook left last night with a case of champagne—there
are all the dishes to wash ... and the boy left
yesterday morning with my two best suits—oh, ho, art
is merely incidental,” continuing his sweeping in vigorous
fashion.</p>

<p>Then he dropped the broom and came down the walk
to meet them.</p>

<p>His garden had the air of age and mystery. The famous
statue of Aphrodite attributed to Praxiteles was in
a monolith of white marble lined with brass and surrounded
by a small fountain which paid her homage. As
soon as midsummer came, he explained to Thurley, there
would be yellow lilies with heavy sweetness, the clean
fragrance of shy heliotrope, creamy, bending tassels of
spiræa forming an aisle up to the white stucco house
with its contrasting dark, wooden trimmings.</p>

<p>But when they entered the hall, Thurley gasped with
amused dismay, for she had seldom seen such conglomeration
and disorder. It was true there were pink marbleized<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
walls, tall lapis lazuli pillars capped with gold and
an emerald malachite cornice with a black baseboard in
the big studio. In addition to the collection of rare
eighteenth century furniture with needlepoint chairs and
blue and silver hangings, the growing plants and endless
bird cages filled with twittering English bullfinches, there
were strewn carelessly rare Greek vases and Etruscan
fragments, an ugly easel and modelling stand, spotted
canvases carelessly lying about. On chairs, but more
often on the floor, were jars of brushes, rare lithographs
by Whistler, Puvis de Chavannes’ drawings, Meryon’s
etchings and Conder’s painted silks. Half finished portraits
and charcoal outlines of figures were pinned relentlessly
on the walls, and a shaggy Airedale answering the
name of Fencer came muzzling the guests in suspicious
welcome and walked without concern on all of the treasures.</p>

<p>The only books the room contained were a well worn
Bible and a Human Anatomy. The curtains were twisted
back into hideous shapes, some fastened with twine, others
with artist’s thumb-tacks, and one was thrown over the
cornice in gay disregard.</p>

<p>“You see,” said Collin, “I never should have yielded
to Caleb’s plea to have an artistic studio. By degrees, I
have managed to move out some stuff and send it over to
his lodge. He thrives on such things—color schemes
and doing rooms over. But some fine day there will be a
bonfire at Parva Sed Apta and, hoop-la, I’ll build a log
cabin with nothing but glass for the roof and sit in the
midst of the débris to paint the most wonderful pictures
of women.”</p>

<p>“Poor women, posing in your log cabin.” Polly pretended
to be cross. “Now we must get this room to
rights.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>

<p>“Never.” He pushed her aside. “I’ll not allow a
thing to be straightened. The rest of the house is like a
bandbox and I spend as little time there as I can. But
here is where I live.”</p>

<p>Fencer lay down to roll over an etching as if emphasizing
the statement.</p>

<p>“Here,” corrected Collin, “is where <em>we</em> live.”</p>

<p>“Show Thurley Bliss’s portrait and then we’ll do up
the dishes and cook our dinner—a fine sort of host you
are.”</p>

<p>“Cook had been meditating an elopement some time—a
gentleman who works in a roundhouse, I believe, has
been carrying the wedding ring in his pocket for days.
The boy always envied my suits—and as he was offered
more wages to go to Bermuda, I presume he thought the
suits a bonus for having endured an artistic atmosphere
... oh, well, I’ll call up the agency to-morrow and order
a fresh supply; they’ll stay a week anyhow and that takes
me through the dinner I’m supposed to give on Wednesday—well,
Thurley, are you much amused?”</p>

<p>They were walking down the hall into his drawing-room,
spick and span by contrast, done in the coolest of
grays with long, glimmering curtains of silver damask,
the furniture of polished magnolia wood with a yellow-topped
Italian marble console and many-branched silver
candlesticks. The only ornament in the room was Hobart’s
portrait; it stood on a great easel on a platform,
curtains halfway veiling it.</p>

<p>Thurley’s heart began an annoying pit-a-pat as she
sought the correct light in which to view it. Polly and
Collin each taking a curtain threw them back together
and for a long instant Thurley was silent as she looked
with eyes, as betraying of her love as Polly’s had been, at
the wonderful face of a man. It was a man who had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
recently left happy youth behind because he had discovered
it to be disillusioning and had taken up manhood
with no disgruntled attitude of resentment nor aggressive
determination to win by trickery but with ideals—ideals
impossible to defeat but hidden so safely from the world
at large that they were incapable of practical expression.
The lips smiled of love and sighed for regret and prayed
for all the universe—there was that much painted into
the picture. The eyes were shining, gray eyes showing
the art of putting a bad ending to the purpose of becoming
a good and fresh beginning. He was one who would
try to practise some ancient but forgotten unity of the
human race. As Thurley stared at the strange face with
its rare smile of understanding, she recalled the Scotch
legend of the Wells of Peace which an old circus clown
had told her of years ago.</p>

<p>The Wells of Peace, so the clown had said, were Love,
Beauty, Dreams, Endurance, Compassion, Rest, Love
Fulfilled! All the “little people” of the hills and forest,
even the peewits who had been baseborn children,
were searching endlessly for the Wells of Peace—for he
who found them and drank of the water could wish for
anything in the world and it would be his!</p>

<p>“Kiss her, Collin; that will make her speak! Are you
turning into a statue, Thurley?”</p>

<p>Thurley stirred at the sound of Polly’s voice.</p>

<p>Collin was holding back the curtain and laughing at
her. “Never knew I could hold a pose so long,” he
said as he dropped it. “Why, Thurley, are you so susceptible
to an old brigand like Bliss? Fancy him, now,
walking down Piccadilly and humming,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“‘I’m going back to Lunnon,</div>
<div class="verse">“‘To tea and long frock coats’</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">—and a bevy of peeresses trailing afterwards!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>

<p>Thurley let the actress in her shield the woman. She
made laughable comments about the portrait, vowing that
the color scheme of the room had given her new ideas for
costumes, going through the rest of Parva Sed Apta with
a careless demeanor.</p>

<p>The dining-room should have been a charming spot
with its green English Chintz, dead white walls and red
and gold furniture, but it was heaped with soiled dishes
and curious cooking utensils piled high with “concoctions.”</p>

<p>“I had a fearful appetite the moment cook left,”
Collin explained, “so I thought I’d try my luck....
They all tasted queer—like mixtures of carpet tacks
and modelling clay. The way I explain it is the excess
paprika and I had been modelling and neglected to wash
my hands.”</p>

<p>“Oh, good,” Polly interrupted. “Show us what you
were doing,” making him return to the studio to rescue
the clay model of a bird with a newly broken wing.</p>

<p>“Splendid,” Polly declared. “There is a force—a
stirring—<i lang="fr">il y a quelque chose</i>,” turning to Thurley for
approval.</p>

<p>“It hurts to look at it, poor little thing! It must
have been from a gun and not an accident.”</p>

<p>Collin actually blushed. “You really feel that, too?”</p>

<p>“Of course—see how the wing drags—oh, why not
model it complete?”</p>

<p>Polly gave a triumphant whistle. “Always told him
so. I wish now that he’s oodles of money, he’d stop
painting fat dowagers and silly men in broadcloth and
model—model what he dreams.”</p>

<p>Collin wrapped the bird in the moist cloth. “You are
partial. I cannot model—nor can I tear myself away
from color. I dream color, woo it, I could eat it—now,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
maybe that was the trouble with the cooking! I
was trying to put taupe shadows in the picture of the
Hooker children ... anyway, Thurley, I worked as
‘ghost’ for the great Constantin and, after seeing his
modelling, I never even fancied I could do likewise. It
is merely remembering my days with him when I take
up the clay, sentimental tribute—artistic fashion of
drinking a toast. He had but one rule: ‘When you
can model a human hand as large as the top of your
thumb, you can model anything,’ he told us.... One
day, when I tried, he said in his carping old fashion,
‘Hein, what is that, Hedley? A hand? So! I would
mark it assaulted toad!’ And I never tried modelling
again.”</p>

<p>He seemed anxious to dismiss the subject and show
them his last portrait. As he talked in his sweet, light
voice, Thurley watched the childlike, tyrannical way in
which he waited for praise and believed all they said of
his work. He was seemingly unconscious of Polly’s
hungry heart—and empty purse—and as Thurley
studied him she realized that Collin possessed a great
virtue—and a great fault.</p>

<p>The virtue was expressed by his brilliant, joyous eyes
which told her his was the sixth sense—the ability to
look at his subject and say, “Ah, I won’t paint in the
heartbreak, it would be too cruel! Just pleasant shadows,”
or “Shall I show the greed which made you play
the cad? I think I shall—it needs to be exploited even
if you did buy off the press,” or “There is a promise of
good things and you shall have them painted clearly so
that when you look at yourself you will feel the need of
living up to that promise—a sort of jacking-up, old
man—with your slightly weak mouth but glorious forehead,”
or “You are young and beautiful and you’ve the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
world before you, but I shall find that gray-gold seriousness
of your woman’s soul and make it illumine your
face; then you won’t go getting too light of heart and
careless of tongue—as you might with the flurry of
dimples!” So the world had come to speak of a Hedley
portrait as something to be almost fearful of—it was so
real—and yet, with this ability, Thurley admitted as the
day wore on with their playing at housekeeping or romping
in the garden, drinking black coffee while Collin and
Polly played guitar and ukelele duets, Collin remained a
child. Whether this was purposely achieved or a strange
whim of Mother Nature was yet to be proved. But a
child he was, whimsical, lovable, worth while but unstable—and
he skillfully shut away the duties of maturity
by this very fact. Collin shirked responsibility! So did
Ernestine, but in a cynical, combative fashion. Collin did
it with studied innocence! As the child has imagination
as its greatest charm and asset, so did Collin claim it
for his own, at the same time retaining that opinion
of women which the child possesses: A woman has but
two possibilities—tyrant or slave, therefore she can
never be his equal. The child regards his nurse or
mother as a guardian angel or an unfair oppressor of
rights, and so Collin chose to regard women—staying
aloof from entangling romance!</p>

<p>He called Polly his pal, said with admiration that she
had never passed out of that flapper period when every
woman wishes she had been born a boy, therefore, Polly
was a delight to know! He helped her when she least
suspected it, liked and admired her, but he kept that
armor of childish irresponsibility about his famous, selfish
self and no matter how keenly he might gaze into the
souls of those he painted, his own soul was wrapped in
nursery eiderdown and labelled, “Unwrap me and you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
destroy genius!” Polly, like all women who love but
once, understood and was content with crumbs.</p>

<p>“I shall go abroad when Ernestine does,” Thurley
heard him saying when she had lured Fencer into the
garden to play retrieve.</p>

<p>“I’m so glad—do get rested, you will be rushed with
orders next winter,” Polly answered. Thurley knew just
the look in those stabbed brown eyes!</p>

<p>“What will you do, pal mine?”</p>

<p>“Be tremendously busy, my opera scores, naturally,
and for a pot-boiler I’ve hired out as proofreader during
the regulars’ vacations. I’m to have a famous summer.”
She picked up the ukelele and began strumming.</p>

<p>“I’ll find you the prettiest mantilla in Spain,” he promised,
“but don’t worry if you have no letters—I can’t
write letters any more than a woman can understand
banking. But you’ll write to me, won’t you, Polly?”</p>

<p>“Of course—we’ll all write,” she answered bravely.</p>

<p>Thurley paused, unmindful of Fencer’s bark, and
pondered on many things, the portrait of the real Bliss
Hobart, the man who was worth winning, as she thought
with new logic, on Miss Clergy’s vow which cheapened
any love no matter how many Lissas might argue to the
contrary—unrequited love such as Polly’s—on Caleb,
smug and amusing and much in need of Ernestine
Christian’s heart, on Ernestine, busy with scales and
cigarettes and pessimistic utterances, on Sam Sparling,
who had told her during one of their happy talks, “Be a
woman first, my child,” on November, with the prospect
of the début ... well, had Dan married Lorraine and
was it true that a man was nothing short of a hero who
married a brilliant woman? What a world it was and
wouldn’t it be a relief to have had Ali Baba say it all for
her with his usual: “Land sakes and Mrs. Davis, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
some folks are going to be mighty nervous when it comes
Judgment Day!”</p>

<p class="tb">At that identical moment in Birge’s Corners, Dan and
Lorraine were driving through the Boston Valley hills.
It had been a hateful Sunday, to Dan’s mind; service in
the morning and himself dancing attendance on the minister’s
daughter when all the time he longed to bolt from
the church to escape the nasal tones of Milly Crawford,
the new soloist from Pike. He wanted to sit on the step
of the box-car wagon in sulky retrospect. But instead,
he meekly followed Lorraine into the parsonage
and ate the dinner she had carefully prepared, smoking
on the porch while Lorraine “did up the work,” and now
they had driven the best part of the afternoon, returning
for the monotonous evening service, the cold meat and
jelly tea and the customary Sunday night courtship on the
vine-covered porch.</p>

<p>“Dan,” said Lorraine timidly, one hand reaching over
to feel the solitaire on the other;—it gave her courage;—“is
the new house getting on all right?”</p>

<p>He turned to look at her; she was such a frail, pretty
thing in her silk dress—three summers old and homemade
at that—her eyes were raised to his as if she were
a good heathen looking at a shrine to ask the granting of
a boon.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he said with dangerous gentleness. “Why?”</p>

<p>She dropped her head. “I was just wondering—”</p>

<p>Dan smiled; the savage, buoyant Dan had vanished.
Fine, hard lines were about his mouth and his eyes were
staring, non-expressive. Every one in the Corners knew
what Lorraine had “put up with” since Thurley Precore
had given him the mitten and he had engaged himself
for spite—the weeks when Dan drank, Lorraine forgiving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
and praying over him, the times when he deliberately
ogled other girls—not the nice girls, either—those
women with hard, bold eyes who always live at the
outskirts of any small town, coming in Saturday nights to
prance along the streets arm in arm, making every one
clear out of their way, who laugh loudly and make humorous
comments when they pass travelling men. Dan had
not only talked with these persons—he had taken them
driving in his car.</p>

<p>Still Lorraine had refused to believe the reports. She
had wept her tears and said her prayers in the solitude of
her room with only the hope chest as confidant. Then
the minister talked to Dan—with the result that Lorraine,
with unheralded defiance, came into the room during
the scene and told her father she was Dan’s bespoken
wife; she would always be willing to “bear with him.”</p>

<p>“Seems as if there’s nothing he can do to get rid of
her except hang himself,” was the village verdict.</p>

<p>“’Course he’s sweet on Thurley—and whatever is she
doing all this time? I guess Miss Clergy has spent
enough money to teach her how to sing,” would be the
answer.</p>

<p>Almost indifferently Dan had resigned himself to his
fate and the new house began to near completion.</p>

<p>“I hope he won’t break out wild after they’re married,”
Ali Baba said.</p>

<p>“A Birge never married no woman with spirit; they
all die and leave a son,” Hopeful used to answer.</p>

<p>“Well, Thurley knew her mind, no matter if it was
right or wrong,” would be Betsey’s consolation.</p>

<p>“Would you like to be married this fall?” Dan finally
asked Lorraine on this Sunday afternoon.</p>

<p>“It’s a little soon, but I guess I could be ready,” she
fibbed according to feminine custom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, I suppose we may as well! Say when.”</p>

<p>Lorraine’s cheeks were crimson with excitement.
“November?”</p>

<p>His face clouded. November was a semi-sacred
month, Thurley’s birth month—but then, was not all the
village sacred because Thurley had lived there? Where
could he turn without a haunting memory, what person
could he pass without recalling some incident in their life
together?</p>

<p>“All right—about the fifteenth; I’ll be ready to get
away then. We’ll go to New York for a couple of weeks.
Would you like that?”</p>

<p>Lorraine nodded. They were both thinking the same
thing: suppose fate should cause them to meet Thurley
Precore?</p>

<p>When Dan left her that night, kissing her dutifully
and saying some polite thing about being a lucky fellow,
Lorraine went upstairs to the little hope chest and began
counting over her woman’s trifles.</p>

<p>“Poor Thurley,” she said out loud, “he’s mine now
... and he will learn to care.”</p>

<p>Dan returned to the Hotel Button and went up to his
rooms. He sat at his desk, scribbling on a bit of paper.
Then he took a fresh sheet and wrote: “Dear Thurley”—but
nothing else suggested itself.</p>

<p>“She wouldn’t give a hoot, you poor fool,” he told
himself.</p>

<p>Finally he tore the paper up and whistling with utmost
cheeriness tramped about the room and tried to take an
interest in planning the decorations of the twenty-thousand-dollar
house. It was Thurley’s house no matter
what all the ministers and marriage licenses might try to
prove to the contrary.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>

<p>Ernestine returned in June nervously overwrought and
almost petulant at having to wait for her sailing reservations.
Thurley saw a new sort of Ernestine Christian,
prophetic hint as to her own future if she continued with
her work.</p>

<p>“Don’t speak to me until we’ve been out at sea for a
day,” Ernestine commanded, “then I’ll be a lovely, rosy
<em>thing</em>, the jolliest big sister ever, and I’ll play the rest of
the summer. Ask Collin—he knows. Collin, Bliss and
I have often crossed together, and when we went aboard
the boys seriously considered asking the steward not to
place us at the same table. By the time we reached
Havre they were making violent love to me, wondering if
their own eyes had played them false in the beginning of
the trip,” after which she unceremoniously bundled Thurley
out of her apartment.</p>

<p>Thurley accepted the hint, as she had plenty to do in
getting Miss Clergy’s summer wardrobe completed and
accompanying her to a rustic lodge in the Adirondacks
where she would drone away the golden summer as she
wished. Thurley had assumed, perforce, a maternal attitude
towards Miss Clergy; she was even dictatorial and
bullied her a trifle about being nice to other elderly persons
who invited Miss Clergy for tea—Thurley had
found this demeanor to have excellent results.</p>

<p>Although it was with relief that she left the ghost-lady
at her summer’s boarding-place, it was with regret
as well. Thurley had begun to feel that Miss Clergy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
“belonged” to her as she had always tried to fancy some
one somewhere must belong to her if she would only be
patient long enough.</p>

<p>“I sha’n’t worry about you,” Miss Clergy had told
her. “You’re the most satisfactory thing I ever owned.”
Unconsciously she had spoken the truth. She did regard
Thurley as a beautiful, talented sort of unsexed person
dependent upon her for existence. Unselfish affection
never entered the partnership. She wondered why Thurley
had turned away so abruptly as she spoke and pretended
she had an errand outside the room.</p>

<p>“‘The most satisfactory thing,’” Thurley kept repeating
as the car wheels turned her nearer New York
and the coveted trip abroad. “‘The most satisfactory
thing’—and I’m an ‘amusing thing’ to Ernestine, almost
as amusing as Silverheels, only she loves Silverheels.
And I’m an ‘interesting young thing’ to Bliss Hobart,
some one who came to earth knowing how to sing and so
he is spared the trouble of teaching me. And I’m a
‘lucky young thing,’ as Polly says, because I’ve the chance
she has not, and I’m a ‘dangerous young thing’ to Lissa
because Mark Wirth likes me—oh, if she knew how
often he sends flowers—and I suppose Caleb thinks me
a ‘worth while young thing’ because he gains hints for
a new heroine.... I want just to be some one’s Thurley!”
She looked at the hills without but she could not
see them distinctly for tear-blurred eyes.</p>

<p>When she reached New York she telephoned Ernestine,
only to be told she could not sail for at least another
week, nor did Ernestine wish to be disturbed,—Silverheels
had been accidentally killed and Ernestine had suffered
a nervous collapse.</p>

<p>Thurley heard the news rather carelessly. “Too
bad,” she had said, “I would rather he went out quickly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
than to be one of those blind little creatures that are a
burden to themselves.”</p>

<p>“You don’t understand,” Ernestine answered sharply.
“You don’t know anything about it. I am taking him
west to an animal cemetery and I shall pick out a handsome
headstone.”</p>

<p>Thurley wondered if this was a strained sort of joke.
“Really?” she asked.</p>

<p>At which came a volley of reproaches over the wire to
the effect that most assuredly would there be a memorial
for Silverheels as well as a headstone; no other animal
could ever take his place nor would she ever allow any
other animal to make inroads into her heart. She wished
his name never to be mentioned; perhaps Thurley would
develop sufficiently within the next few years to comprehend
that animal tragedies were the hardest to bear!</p>

<p>Which left Thurley feeling like a smacked infant not
at all knowing the reason for the smacking.</p>

<p>The hotel suite seemed musty and in bad taste as she
wandered about restlessly. She must wait now until Ernestine
chose to sail; she must keep away from her and
amuse herself. She did not want to worry Miss Clergy
with writing of the delay and she had closed her lesson
books with an eager hand. Polly was busy doing some
sort of hack work, and she supposed Collin would go off
to Europe on the steamer they had planned to take.
Anyway, she felt a shy reserve in calling him up to find
out.</p>

<p>She was halfway angered at being forced into this submissive
attitude. When she was a prima donna earning
her own money she resolved that she would lead her own
life in no half tones. It was all very well to know interesting,
famous persons but to be at the mercy of their
thousand and one peculiar notions and erratic actions was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
another matter. She noticed that Collin respected
Ernestine’s wishes and Ernestine also respected Collin’s.
Save for Caleb’s being in love with Ernestine
and thus being rendered somewhat helpless, he followed
his own inclinations and permitted Ernestine to do
likewise. No one dreamed of telling Bliss Hobart what
to do and what not to do and never did any one, although
disapproving of Lissa, contemplate trying to reform
her. Mark danced as he would and lived as he wished
and there was an end of it. And who in the wide world
had more latitude than Sam Sparling, who flirted with a
duchess one day and had a shop girl driving in his car the
next, giving midnight orgies for “the boys” and sending
them packing when his nerves gave warning—Sam who
flew off to Lake Louise one day, recklessly cancelling engagements,
and returning very keen for the green room
and the footlights to play for weeks at a time and then
“hop across,” as he said, to Paris to rent some crumbling
château and have it put in the pink of condition while he
was engrossed in reading and rehearsing a new repertoire
like a veritable savant. Lucky Sam, Lissa, Mark,
Ernestine, Collin, Caleb—all of them for that matter!
Thurley’s lips were rebellious of expression as she sat
that warm June morning before the window, looking at
the Avenue which throbbed with personalities each bent
on its own way.</p>

<p>She registered a vow that she, too, would acquire a
personality, a hobby, a “phobia,” an intricate set of nerves
and a color scheme—dear, yes, there should be no end
to her “dew-dabs,” as Hobart named them. She would
even have her own perfume, she would “recommend” a
certain fabric and have her picture taken in a gown of it
and printed in a leading fashion journal. She would rule
over her apartment as rigorously as these others ruled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
over theirs; she would evolve a distinctive form of entertainment—to
say nothing of openly indulging in moods
and sulks and wild bursts of joy—and cigarettes and
liquors if they did not harm her voice. This should be
the reward for these snubbed months of being the spectator,
dependent on some one else’s bounty.</p>

<p>There likewise came an impulse not worthy of the real
Thurley—nevertheless it came as strongly and with as
much temptation as all the rest of her tempestuous plans.
When she was rich and famous and still beautiful, she
would return to the Corners to haunt Dan Birge as he had
never dreamed a woman could haunt him. She would
have some sort of romantic interest in her life even if
she had given her pledge to Miss Clergy never to make
the hideous mistake of marriage.</p>

<p>As she sat there, some one tapped at the door and,
running to open it, she found Caleb Patmore dressed in
motor togs, his goggles pushed up on his forehead and
a linen duster buttoned to his chin.</p>

<p>“I suppose you’re in mourning,” he said whimsically,
“or have you insulted Ernestine by suggesting it is madness
to swelter in town another week while she interviews
all the monument makers as to the most fetching feline
memorial?”</p>

<p>Thurley gave him a grateful expression. “It does
seem foolish.”</p>

<p>“I’ve been banished forever from her presence—because
I sent no flowers,” he laughed. “However, she
told me to get you and take you out for the day—she
can’t keep her June day custom of visiting me at the lodge
and you are appointed proxy. Come along, you look
ready for a frolic.”</p>

<p>Thurley raced into her bedroom and tilted her hat
over one eye. “My word, it will be good to go somewhere.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
Imagine coming back from the mountains bubbling
with excitement and finding the trip delayed for
days. If it had been hours I would not have minded—but
days—”</p>

<p>“And you’ve never been across, have you?” he asked
sympathetically.</p>

<p>“Oh, never,” she answered in despair. “You don’t
think Ernestine will give up the trip, do you?”</p>

<p>“Not as bad as that, because she has persuaded Collin
to wait the week as well. It might be worse. All set,
are you? First, I’ve some errands and then we’ll shoot
out to the lodge and I’ll feed you the best strawberries
floating in the richest cream you ever tasted.”</p>

<p>Thurley found bromidic enjoyment in Caleb’s country
place. It was refreshing in its air of order. She felt
that to be a commercialized artist had compensations, at
least it enabled one to acquire what one wished of
true art and appreciate it all the more by contrast with
one’s own attempts!</p>

<p>Returning to the hotel, she found a note from Ernestine
saying she had “come out of it” sufficiently to engage
passage for the following Tuesday and she hoped
Thurley would never mention Silverheels to her nor invite
tragedy herself by acquiring a pet.</p>

<p>Thurley lay awake that hot summer’s night—the nearness
of the vacation did not delight her over-much. Instead,
she was thinking of herself as contrasted with
Bliss, Collin, Ernestine, Caleb—even Polly. For there
was a difference of birthright between these persons and
herself. With a burning sense of discontent yet enforced
honesty, Thurley realized that she had in herself a strain
of sturdy peasantry; these others were more gently born—there
was a difference in the way they spoke, dressed—she
felt too superlative and over-insisting in comparison.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
She wondered whether in time she would acquire
the atmosphere of gentle breeding which these persons
possessed. Lissa had somewhat the same strain as herself—and
she prayed she would not become like Lissa.</p>

<p>The difference between the peasant and the patrician,
Thurley concluded, after restless reflection, was that the
peasant cannot endure pain, physical or mental, as well
as he can stand hardships, lack of the niceties of existence,
whereas the patrician can endure anguish but he
cannot tolerate discomfort. A poorly fitting or coarse
gown would prevent Ernestine from playing her best,
whereas Thurley could sing in calico, standing on the
steps of her old box-car wagon. Ernestine could “rescue”
herself from suffering, a sort of diking away
of any too engulfing emotion, whereas, if Thurley’s heart
was aching or her mental state disturbed, she would
not sing—she was like a wood beastie wanting to dart
into deep forests and hide indefinitely.</p>

<p>Thurley had begun to long for ancestors, she admitted
with a sigh; to possess portraits of spinsters with crumbling
lace fichus and slim, white hands—Aunt so-and-so
or Grandmother and Grandfather Precore! She wanted
heirlooms, some tangible evidence of a family. Winter
circus quarters with the pretended family recalled themselves
to her with scant comfort. She was so young and
promising and she was to spend her life singing for the
world and not for any one loved person! There had
been Dan who wanted her to sing for just himself. Had
she loved Dan as Lorraine did, she would have been
content to have it so. She would have married Dan
by now, the new house would be glowing with rosy
shaded lamps, passers-by would halt their teams to
listen to Thurley singing to her husband ... but that
was not the way it was to be. If only some kind spirit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
with the power to release vows and wave a wand to
change things about could do so and create such a house
as Dan planned for her and yet have Bliss Hobart be its
master and Thurley its mistress—how very silly and
stupid would New York and opera seem, all these over-smart
and cynical persons with self-consciousness their dominating
note and selfish egotism their guardian angel!
She would sing for her husband and work to please him.
And how simple was the big rule of life, Thurley thought,
as she sat up among the pillows, sleep the furthest from
her thoughts: Love some one and have some one love
you and make everything else resultant and interdependent!
She sank back slowly—for she had promised
never to marry and in so doing it had come about that
she should meet the person whom she would have married
had he been a steam-riveter! Ernestine and Europe
seemed phantoms—she was not interested. Nor was
she interested in Dan and Lorraine and their future.
She was unconscious of everything except that Bliss Hobart
treated her for the most part impersonally, disappearing
without explanation although the Buddha still
stayed on his desk.</p>

<p>Mark, Lissa, Polly, Sam and Caleb saw the trio set
sail—as gay a farewell as one could imagine, with Lissa
in a costume indicating that she had achieved social distinction
and Polly with her funny epigrams and humorous
antics, clever mask for her aching heart. Mark had
sent Thurley a basket of roses which were to be delivered
that evening, but which the steward stupidly
hauled to light before Lissa’s eyes.</p>

<p>“You better play safe,” Caleb murmured to Mark
who was hanging over Thurley’s chair and refusing to
notice Lissa’s efforts to get him away.</p>

<p>“One doesn’t see a girl like Thurley off for her first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
trip across every day,” Mark answered. “Anyway,
she’ll not be bothering with any of us in a year’s time;
she’s destined to have a coronet on her handkerchief.”</p>

<p>Sam Sparling had made Thurley count inkstains on
his fingers, which he had obtained by writing letters of
introduction to his friends scattered in France and England.
Collin, who was in a fearful stew about having
left behind his pet kit of brushes, fumed up and down
the deck with Caleb reminding him that there were shops
in Paris.</p>

<p>Polly stood towards the rear of the group as they
were given their shore warning.</p>

<p>“Good-by, Polly—a world of luck!” Collin said
easily.</p>

<p>“Good-by, Collin—the same to you!”</p>

<p>“Good-by,” Ernestine called out. “When you see
me next, I’ll be known as Thurley’s chaperone—I’m submerging
my personality!”</p>

<p>“Good-by—America,” a sudden childish fear took
possession of Thurley.</p>

<p>A chorus of jeers answered her. “Really? Well,
nothing like being impersonal first to last.... I say,
Thurley, if you’re not more polite, we’ll go buy a locket
and each chop off a lock of hair and stick inside. How
would you like that for an albatross?”</p>

<p>“Good-by, Americans,” she corrected, “it’s just—just—”</p>

<p>“Sing it,” suggested Polly.</p>

<p>Without ado, Thurley began “Auld Lang Syne,” causing
waving handkerchiefs to be pressed to eyes and every
one aboard to ask who the tall girl was with the glorious
voice and if she was to sing at ship’s concert?</p>

<p>Ernestine shrugged her shoulders as the song ended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
and Thurley, abashed at the furore, sank down in her
steamer chair. Harsh tug whistles took up the burden
of noise.</p>

<p>“You’ll learn not to waste your songs,” was all Ernestine
said.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>

<p>Thurley’s début was the night of November sixteenth,
nor was it <i>Marguerite</i> as she fondly hoped but as <i>Rosina</i>
in “The Barber of Seville,” the rôle which she had so
often sung during her lessons with Hobart and in which
she felt scant interest.</p>

<p>Returning with breathless memories of the beloved Old
World as skilfully shown her by her famous couriers,
Thurley had waited with equal breathlessness to find
Bliss Hobart who had not sent her so much as a penny
post card during her weeks abroad.</p>

<p>She found him keen, alert, the personification of energy
but as noncommittal as to his summer as the sphinx, annoyed
at some of Thurley’s mistakes, a hint of nervousness
at daring to bring her out so soon—in short, a
taskmaster with scant time for jokes or confidences. Indeed,
Thurley found herself snubbed by the entire family;
they had their parties without her, explaining that she
needed her time for study and preparation. Even Miss
Clergy, who was refreshed from her summer, became a
mild sort of “goader-on.” As the hour for her triumph
drew near, she was irritable and impatient if Thurley
wandered away for a walk, was five minutes late or said
her headache prevented a lesson.</p>

<p>It was annoying to have a grownup, cynical world suddenly
center its interest on Thurley, the wild-rose Thurley
who had basked in the Old-World beauties, responding
to French vivacity, “toning in,” as Collin said, to the
mellowed charms of Spain and feeling at home directly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
upon reaching London. Thurley longed to tarry on in
Europe a year, she had told Ernestine.</p>

<p>“It makes me feel unprepared; I see how very new and
crude I am.” But Ernestine had planned their schedule
without thought as to Thurley’s wishes, so on they went
with Thurley learning how to travel and speak her
French, to dress, to practise all the things the social secretary
had labored to impart. She sent back impractical
trifles to the inhabitants of the Fincherie, writing
to Miss Clergy dutifully, and mentally writing whole
volumes to Bliss Hobart yet seldom mentioning his name
aloud.</p>

<p>So passed her summer. And after the weeks of
preparation there came a reaction, a bored languor, indifference
to her success. Dreams seemed dead and
visions vanished; the girl Thurley who had exchanged
love for a career was some one else; surely, she had
never heard tell of her. At the present moment she
was in a veritable squirrel cage, racing after what seemed
unattainable fame; she had so many persons to suit, so
many persons waited to hear and criticize her and yet
there was only one person whom she really wished to
please. He had told her quite forcibly,</p>

<p>“As soon as you are nicely launched, Thurley, I’ve a
contralto from Argentine whom Baxter has in tow—stocky
build and will have to bant, but she has an
organlike voice and can do wonders in Wagner—only
she’ll take time which, thank fortune, you did not.”</p>

<p>This Thurley took as a personal expression of relief
and she went away more bored and numbed than ever,
thoroughly insolent to all who crossed her path that
day. Ernestine herself could not have achieved it better.</p>

<p>There was the introduction to the stage itself and
her future associates. Thurley thanked heaven for blasé<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
indifference at that time. She conducted herself at rehearsals
with the poise of a diplomat and when she sang
the impassioned love scene in the singing lesson of “The
Barber of Seville” she almost laughed at the famous
tenor who irritably accepted this rôle with a “so-great-nobody,”
as he mockingly informed Thurley, rushing off
to meet his last affinity and be properly comforted.</p>

<p>She began to see the truth of Lissa’s prophecy regarding
the life of opera singers. Yet this anesthesia of
indifference spared her harsh emotions or critical judgments.
She was merely keeping her pledge, she told herself
night after night when she was finally alone with her
thoughts.</p>

<p>All of which won her the title of conceited and spoiled
and certain to fail. Bliss Hobart saw her ruse and kept
his own counsel; Miss Clergy thought it her eternal
triumph over personal affection and whispered to Thurley
of her satisfaction. And when the great night of
nights came and Thurley, as unconcernedly as if she were
at the old meeting house on a Sunday morning, stood and
accepted curtain calls and baskets of flowers, trying not
to remember the tenor’s repeated comment, “You so-great-nobody,
you been drinking witches’ broth,”—Thurley
knew she had succeeded. Her début was
ended. Hereafter she was free to command her own
life—life was really beginning for her anew, since it
had temporarily stopped the day she left the Corners
and these strange people had lived it for her in a vicarious
fashion. Now that she had won fame—with
the loss of love—she had won freedom and she was
Thurley Precore, prima donna!</p>

<p>After the last act, when Thurley’s dressing-room was
a buzz of animated conversation and the scent of the
flowers almost sickish, when her new maid fluttered nervously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
about and Bliss Hobart came in to say, “I knew
you would—so there’s nothing to exclaim about, is
there?”—and all the sisters of the press clamored for
“a word,” with others crowding about and looking properly
animated and delighted, Miss Clergy whispered,</p>

<p>“My darling, how proud I am,” and Thurley recoiled,
she knew not why.</p>

<p>“A finer bridegroom than Dan Birge,” the ghost-lady
was murmuring, “fame! He is the finest bridegroom
of all—fame, Thurley—and I’m so proud of
you!”</p>

<p>Naturally there was a “party” which Thurley actually
dreaded since she felt she could not yet assert her independence.
She was like a gay young eaglet chained
and longing to soar where she would! Yet she must sit
quietly and be praised and petted, the object of excessive
sentiments, just as family birthday dinners are a signal
for numberless indulgences. Thurley was eager to have
done with the unusual, to live as she wished to live.</p>

<p>That first opera was a distinct blur, just as the rehearsals
were blurs as soon as they ended. She realized
she had jeopardized her liberty in a psychic fashion
and given her word to certain things. She had finally
served her apprenticeship and was now liberated. Why,
she had sung <i>Rosina</i> just as she had often sung lullabies
to tired children or for Philena. Stupid world—God
gave her a voice as He did brown hair and blue eyes, to
herself belonged no credit. Yet here they sat about Bliss
Hobart’s elegant supper table—Ernestine in her blue
and gold and leopard skin gown and Caleb beside her,
Lissa in startling cerise and jet trying to call Thurley
“my darling child” and honeycomb her jealousy of Mark
who ogled her in silly fashion. There was Miss Clergy,
the real perpetrator of it all, who kept staring at her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
protégée in almost rude fashion, trying to realize that she
had finally achieved her revenge! That was food and
drink enough. Bliss Hobart was at Thurley’s right
hand, a manager at her left; there were some critics and
society satellites who had succeeded in being invited; Sam
Sparling appeared with a girl on each arm, as he
flippantly explained; while Thurley was a radiant but
indifferent goddess, “the yellow peril,” according to
Caleb’s description, in her brocaded frock with trimmings
of silver. So they drank her health and sang her praises
and all the time the wild-rose part of her laughed at
them because she had not done her best nor anything to
her mind which was unusual. In a different fashion,
she had merely “sung for her supper” as she had once
done in Birge’s Corners!</p>

<p>When she reached the hotel, Miss Clergy wanted to
talk and gloat, in truth, over the evening’s event.</p>

<p>But Thurley shook her head. “I’m tired; even nightingales
do nest,” she said, picking up some letters.</p>

<p>They were mostly begging for trade from modistes and
milliners but one in a scraggling writing was post-marked
“Birge’s Corners.”</p>

<p>Thurley opened it. After a moment she said in an
even voice, “They are well and Ali Baba has made a new
stormshed for the front.... Dan and Lorraine were
married two days ago.” Then she went into her room,
blowing Miss Clergy a hypocritical kiss.</p>

<p>She was ashamed, as she lay down to sleep, that instead
of thinking of her newly acquired freedom and
success she was envying Dan Birge and Lorraine. Not
even the sob sisters of the press would have guessed
what the new and incomparable prima donna thought on
the night of her début. It concerned neither her throat
troubles nor her complexion, her possible suitors nor her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
coming wealth. But the question asked itself time
without end: “Is it better to spoil one’s youth than to
do nothing with it?”</p>

<p class="tb">That same evening Dan and Lorraine, ill at ease
in their overpowering hotel suite eight squares away
from Thurley’s hotel, had faced somewhat the same
query. For they had come to New York directly following
their wedding to spend a restless day with Thurley’s
memory pursuing them like a ghost.</p>

<p>Then Lorraine dared to voice the matter. “The
paper says Thurley will sing to-night,” she ventured.</p>

<p>“If you don’t mind, I’d like to go,” Dan answered.</p>

<p>They dropped the subject and spoke of the bromidic
details concerning the wedding gifts, what to do with
duplicates and the color of the living-room tapestry
suite and the beauty of the Queen Anne walnut dining
room furnishings which every one said were in better
taste than mahogany, the new house with the wonderful
fixtures, the electric plugs for lamps, the revolving ice
box, the white range, the pergola and sun parlor and
the iron deer which was ordered but not yet arrived.
How happy two young mortals could have been! Besides,
there was the butler’s pantry—heaven knows why
it was dubbed butler’s pantry in the Corners—and the
garage with a washing rack, if you please! Then there
was the wedding itself—a proper chrysanthemum wedding
with three bridesmaids, a matron of honor and a
ringbearer. Lorraine’s father had married them—“so
sweet” as every one agreed—and the church was a
bower of blossoms while the wedding cake was in white
boxes with the initials of the bride and groom entwined
in gold. Lorraine’s wardrobe had been the only meagre
thing and that, Dan generously said, would soon be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
remedied. He had ordered a shower of orchids for her
to carry and given her a sunburst of diamonds, while her
wedding ring broke all Birge’s Corners’ precedents, for
it was a platinum circlet dotted with diamonds. The
Corners did not know whether or not to approve this last.
It was “going some,” the younger generation said, and
the recently married girls boasting of plain and a trifle
ponderous gold bands said that they wouldn’t feel
respectably married with that funny kind of a ring, but
then Lorraine’s father being a minister and every one
present at the church, they supposed it was all right—every
one had her own ideas.</p>

<p>Lorraine wore a new dress to the opera, one she had
bought that morning. Not yet accustomed to her husband’s
generosity, she had visited a second-rate shop to
obtain the slimsy blossom pink silk with cheap trimming.
She had only her travelling coat of dark wool for a wrap
and a stupid hat breathing of home millinery.</p>

<p>She knew Dan was not pleased. As she looked at
him in his tuxedo she realized that she was not yet “used
to being rich”; she would buy the goods for dresses and
make them herself, she could then have so many more.</p>

<p>“Will I do for to-night?” she asked timidly, knowing
the contrast between herself and Thurley would be cruelly
unfair. She winced from it as any woman would wince
from having to sit beside the man she loved while he
watched the woman of his heart appear in beautiful
triumph! Besides, Lorraine had never been to a theater,
her father not approving; she was nervous lest she make
some embarrassing <i lang="fr">faux pas</i>.</p>

<p>“Yes, no one knows us in New York,” he said carelessly.</p>

<p>Then they watched Thurley in all her loveliness come
on the stage in her <i>Rosina</i> costume of red, yellow and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
black lace. Lorraine glanced at Dan as Thurley sang
and triumphed and sang again and triumphed more and
the people near them kept asking who she was. Lorraine,
with her pitiful bargain frock, her unpowdered face
and awkward bonnet, knew that a shadow had fallen between
Dan and herself—Thurley’s shadow—no longer
a wild rose, generous and kindly of heart, but a prima
donna, the woman that Dan would love hopelessly forever
and a day.</p>

<p>She applauded Thurley generously, turning her wistful
face to Dan’s to say, “She is lovely, isn’t she?”
But Lorraine knew that not even the new house with its
furnishings nor her wedding ring nor the diamond sunburst
could still all the pain of knowing that she had
been “married for spite”; she might be the most tender
wife and excellent housekeeper in the world yet she
was not Thurley, lovely, tyrannical! And as she
watched the opera with Thurley its dominating note and
Dan’s moody face now defiant, now almost glad, she
recalled the superstition about women who married
Birge men,—meek little creatures they were who lived
only long enough to bear a son and then smiled contentedly
and were snuffed out into the unknown!</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>

<p>At first fame was good to have, there was no mistaking
it. For Thurley achieved delightful freedom by the
magic of her success. She began to do all she had
planned during her novice period, to try this or that
sort of costume, to give “affairs,” if you please; she cultivated
a hobby and a “phobia” and acquired a smart
wire-haired terrier called “Taffy” whose picture was
featured in all the leading newspapers and musical
journals.</p>

<p>It did not take her long to readjust herself to this new
life. Older, tired persons who had played godmother
and godfather to her during her apprenticeship watched
her in amusement. Not that Thurley ceased to apply
herself to work; she was untiring in her efforts, for she
felt she would never want to stop learning new and
more difficult things. Nor did she stop knowing any
one save those who could be of use to her. Instead there
was exhibited a refreshing democracy of spirit which
governed her likes and dislikes.</p>

<p>Bliss told Caleb, “She’s a pleasant little Trojan
and one can see at a glance, save for amusing whims, she
is as reliable as a grandfather’s clock.” And he told
Thurley, who hovered about hoping for some personal
understanding or praise,</p>

<p>“Just be sincere and everything else trues up—and
don’t grow plump like Lissa, because banting is an awful
bugbear.”</p>

<p>At which Thurley tossed her newly laurel-crowned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
head and determined to try artifice to make him pay her
attention. After all, these fads and fashions were
merely antidotes to make her forget the thing she craved
foremost—Bliss Hobart’s real friendship. So she
ordered lavishly of whatsoever she chose, moving without
delay into an apartment, with Miss Clergy tottering
contentedly after. It was a personal triumph for Miss
Clergy; with Thurley it was only the natural result of
having been born a singer.</p>

<p>“I have my own ideas for my apartment,” she told
Ernestine with patronage, even waving aside Lissa’s suggestions
for a “love of a boudoir—just the place for
proposals” and returning Mark’s offering of a gilt mirror
because it did not harmonize with her color scheme!</p>

<p>“Let her play away, she’ll tire of it,” Sam Sparling
said indulgently, when Polly dropped in at the theater
to recount Thurley’s latest exploit, the purchase of antique
Egyptian jewelry which she was to wear in “Aïda.”</p>

<p>“Have you seen her apartments?” asked Polly.
“Not like Thurley at all. I associate her with real
mahogany and open fireplaces—rose-garden things.”</p>

<p>“I’ll blow up that way to-morrow afternoon,” Sam
promised.</p>

<p>Which he did—only to be amazed himself at the
effect Thurley had managed to create. Her living room
had a blue floor, a blue arch and lapis lazuli colored
pedestals. There was a turquoise satin fire screen, a
globe of blue Bristol glass and the walls and ceilings
were done in rich, silver leaf paper with impossible gilt
furniture set at futurist angles throughout the apartment.
Apricot linen curtains threw a strange, mellow
glow on the black dining-room, the walls being brocaded
black velvet with red alabaster bowls on tripods and a
riotous futurist frieze running about the room. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
were side tables of audacious rose-red marble and the
dining table and chairs were polished ebony while an onyx-like
mantel boasted of silver bowls heaped with glass
colored fruits.</p>

<p>Sam, who knew no restraint, came rapping boldly at
the door of Thurley’s own room, after an astonished
stroll through the apartment.</p>

<p>A <i lang="fr">chic</i> maid opened the door with the properly startled
expression always registered in Caleb’s novels.</p>

<p>“I say, Thurley, you’ve done yourself proud,” Sam
lounged in the doorway to view the white Empire furniture
with elaborate gold scroll, the blue velvet hangings,
the cabinet of slippers and hair ornaments arranged, no
one knew why, not even Thurley herself, as if for display.</p>

<p>Thurley, who was preparing to take dinner at the
Hotel Particular with half a dozen new and decidedly unconventional
creatures, tried to look indignant.</p>

<p>“You’re a monster,” she said as she shook her finger
at him in imitation of Lissa. At which Sam burst out
laughing and vowed he would have her for his leading
lady no matter if he had to send Bliss flying off yon cliff.</p>

<p>“You ridiculous child,” spoiling her dignity completely,
“who in the world started you to shake fingers in old
beaux’ faces? And dressing like the adventuress in
‘Lights o’ London’? Do put on your rumpled blue
serge and let’s go for a drive!”</p>

<p>Thurley swept by him in indignation, Sam following
and side-stepping her train. She wore a band of black
jet in her carefully dressed hair and a gown of black to
match, over which was a long cape of unspotted ermine.</p>

<p>She stood beside the piano to draw on her gloves. “It
isn’t fair to scold in front of a new maid,” she said,
“and contradict me or not, Sam, I am grown up. I can’t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
go about like a flapper or keep on living in a hotel.”</p>

<p>“What does Miss Clergy say?” Sam balanced himself
first on his toes and then sank back on his heels.</p>

<p>“She smiles, nods, agrees and never wants me to
repay her. But, joy of joys, I can. For I’m going to
be rich—really rich and I’m young; I have years in
which to dash about without a thought as to rest or digestion.
Don’t you approve?” She finished buttoning
her gloves and proceeded to open a florist’s box critically
to take notice of a corsage of yellow tea roses.</p>

<p>“Mark does send such ultra things,” she complained
languidly. At which Sam Sparling nearly upset himself
by overbalancing and then came up to take hold of her
shoulders as if she were a small boy in need of a trouncing.</p>

<p>“Young lady, let an old beau give a word of advice.
They say a word to the wise is sufficient and you were,
formerly, wise and apple-cheeked and delicious. We
all adored you. To-day I feel I ought to call you Lady
Vere de Vere and tuck intriguing notes in that corsage,
all that sort of thing ... my dear, play away, for it’s
not to be wondered at, but don’t, oh, don’t, Thurley, let
it supersede the real you. I remember Ernestine Christian
had a whirl at it when she first came into prominence.
Dear yes, jewels and furs that every woman envied—flirtations—a
bit psychological were her flirtations as I
remember; she particularly went in for Hindu poets and
consuls. But flirtations, nevertheless! Then she used
to give all manner of absurd parties—there was one
in London that laid me up a fortnight. It began with ice
cream and cordials and ended with the Lord Mayor of
London’s own turtle soup—had it sent over by gold
braided beadles and so on. You had to eat each course in
a different spot. You were kept on the move, so to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
speak. I remember munching my alligator pear somewhere
near the Tower of London, only to be whisked
off to Whitechapel to be set up directly with the neatest
sort of a game plate! Well, she tired of playing that
way and one day she appeared at my dressing room in
a rough tweed suit and a felt hat saying,</p>

<p>“‘Sam, I’ve buttered buns in this hamper and pale,
schoolboy sherry. Let’s walk until we’re so hungry that
we’ll sit down and eat like beggars—and I can make
a proper confession of what a fool I’ve been!’”</p>

<p>Thurley tried not to laugh and succeeded in commanding
an unbecoming frown. “Well, you didn’t try to
restrain her,” she insisted.</p>

<p>“Ernestine is a different type. I’m afraid you
wouldn’t look at mere Hindu poets or consuls.”</p>

<p>“What of yourself?”</p>

<p>“Hands up, I confess. I had a passion for coaching
tours and those horrible alderman-like banquets. I
seemed to be tremendously popular with the buds—I
was cad enough to keep all their letters for a long time.
When they began to have grandchildren send me notes
saying, ‘Granny says to ask if you remember the time
you played <i>Romeo</i> and so and so’—I stopped being such
a great house, ordered health-last shoes and got a line on
the really reliable sanitariums. But you, Thurley,”—The
old-beau aspect of himself seemed dimmed; he appeared
a fatherly old gentleman rich in experience and
therefore wise in judgment. She felt like a naughty child
who has been discovered while parading in her mother’s
finery. She could not have told why, but she felt artificial,
as if she should be on the stage of the opera house
singing her heart away in some lavish rôle—as <i>Violetta</i>
in “Traviata” for instance—but not as Thurley Precore!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span></p>

<p>“You’d even make me believe there was no Santa
Claus,” she protested, the actress in her rallying to her
support. “Don’t tell me to don a pinafore and become
interested in botany! It’s such fun to play—and so
new; none of you seem to realize that.” Here she trailed
off into silence, busy with her own thoughts, Mark’s
corsage slipping from her fingers.</p>

<p>She was remembering Dan and Lorraine and the day
the child Thurley and Philena pledged to be missionaries,
the advent into the Clergy mansion as a madcap mischief,
the singing in Betsey’s parlor that momentous June
day, the quarrel with Dan, the wonderful journey to the
city with the ghost-lady, then Bliss ... here the
thoughts ended and she found herself thanking Sam for
returning her corsage.</p>

<p>“As for this sort of thing,” the old actor finished,
pointing at the corsage, “you’ll have many of them—but
choose wisely and for all time. Don’t waste time
on worthless phantoms; remember ‘To-morrow feeds on
yesterday.’ Even if you fancy you are merely playing
at being a ‘grand lady,’ and that you yourself are unspoiled
and truly great, think of the bon mot: ‘Imitation
is sincerest flattery,’ and do not ape Lissa any more
than you can help.”</p>

<p>“None of you understand,” she cried, rebelliously.
“I shall do as I wish and live as I choose—as you have
all done.”</p>

<p>“Look at us and take warning,” ended Sam promptly.
“Well, if you get crowded to the wall, call on me. I’ll
be about.” After this he went on his way undecided
whether or not merely to admire Thurley as another dear
charmer on whom his heart had undeniably been frittered
away or to take her seriously as if she were a hope-to-die
ward given into his guardianship.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span></p>

<p>Meanwhile, Thurley went on to the dinner party remembering
Sam’s audacity with annoyance intermingled
with delight. There was and always will be to every
woman, if she is honest, a rare charm in being treated
as a little girl. White-haired matrons delight in being
named “girl” and being told by some one a trifle whiter
of hair and more numerous of birthdays: “My child,
what in the world are you dreaming of?” It is a harmless
notion with which every woman is endowed.</p>

<p>Thurley was born more or less of a woman, so that
Sam’s attitude appealed to her. But the peacock which
is also in all women and the love of domination, remnant
of glorious idol worship, made her reject his halfway offered
protectorship.</p>

<p>It was wonderful to dress in rich fashion, to have Mark
take her to some bohemian table d’hôte—like that of the
Petispas Sisters—to know she would be the handsomest
and best-dressed person there and that Lissa was
helplessly furious at Mark’s new object of adoration, yet
obliged to smile instead of snarl in Thurley’s presence.
It was fun to read letters from unknown admirers, to have
schoolgirls with vast ambitions and opinions of their
abilities appeal to her, as well as embryo tenors from
small towns who only needed a gracious, sisterly hand to
guide them, and press agents out of a job who were
capable of the greatest scheme for procuring public interest
that ever alarm-clocked! Thurley was just realizing
the parasites, so-called artistic, who beg, steal or
demand their living from those who really work and
earn one. She was beginning to classify the large army
of restless rebel women who really delude themselves into
believing they have a mission in life, badgering all
those who simply do the work they were intended for.
These women interested Thurley. She regarded them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
as one views a new member of the zoo, poking sticks at
them through the bars when the guard is not alert.</p>

<p>She had listened to these creatures tell their woes with
childish audacity; she liked their superlative mode of
expression rendering their case hopelessly weak and insincere,
she was amused by the comic opera fashion in
which they dressed or the masculine over-emphasis in
costume details. There were women of the pale, willowy
type—“misunderstood” was their slogan. There were
the bold, aggressive women who despised sentiment and
who longed to prove to men that they were truly a non-essential
race, who grew so enthusiastic over what they
could do for one Thurley Precore as her advance agent,
companion, secretary and so on that Thurley fully expected
them to bark or walk up the wall, as she told
Ernestine. There were women of the dreamy, neurotic
type who never mentioned mother back in Oshkosh still
cooking “three squares a day” for her houseful of boarders
in order that Myrtle or Poincianna might have a
winter in New York in which to study design! Design
was right—but not as mother fancied it was!</p>

<p>Oftentimes Thurley felt she must stop playing a part—mischievous
young person!—and say to these misguided
rebel-dolls that they were fortunate in having just
plain folks, to have any one really belonging to them—a
vista of forbidden joys would open before her blue eyes
as these “hysterical hikers,” as Bliss Hobart had named
them, told her of how they had come away from the
sordid, uninteresting atmosphere which strangled their
inner selves and they were willing to go hungry—all the
great ones had gone hungry—to deny the fleshpots if
they might only achieve—might win the laurel! After
the large flow of language when called upon to demonstrate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
their abilities, they would warble in a reedy soprano:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">The vi-o-let loves the pans-y</div>
<div class="verse"><span class="smcapuc">FOR</span>—the robin told me so-o-o—</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Or else they would use a coal-bin contralto to inform
Thurley all about the Lost Chord and ask if they did
not remind her of Clara Butts!</p>

<p>It was a merry life, because Thurley had not reached
the stage of acknowledging that she had nerves. She
revelled in this court of appeals from which the others
fled.</p>

<p>Caleb had reached the neurasthenic stage where he
wanted a periscope attached to his porch so he could spot
approaching authors laden with a manuscript. Every
time a young author did brave the portcullis and obtain
an audience, only to ask Caleb if there really was not
everything in a name—editors were so mean, anyhow,
and every one said so, and if Caleb would permit his
novel, which every one said was <em>the</em> American novel,
too, to be printed under Caleb’s name and thus play a
roaring joke on these haughty and unfair editors, why,
he would go fifty-fifty on the royalties—every time this
happened to Caleb, he promptly disappeared on a champagne
debauch and refused to express any penitence whatsoever
concerning it!</p>

<p>Or if Collin was held up by a young woman with a
badly powdered nose and a thatch of flaxen hair hiding all
her features save the nose and was asked if she could not
be his inspiration, Collin lost no time in rewarding himself
for the ordeal. His bags were packed, and his motor
was at the gate, even if the president of a steel trust was
due for a portrait sitting. Away he flew over hill and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
dale like a startled rabbit, reaching some rural inn where
art consisted of framed lithographs, and here he lay in
hiding until his disposition had sufficiently recovered to
allow his return as a smiling, bow-tie-waving artist, brush
poised for action!</p>

<p>Therefore the family regarded Thurley’s liking for
the onslaught of hysterical hikers as a sort of puppy
soap-chewing-and-distemper stage.</p>

<p>“Let it run its course, they all do,” Hobart said when
it was reported to him. “She’ll grow weary of autographing
photographs and of having every would-be
genius from the wilds of Oregon try to crowd into a
basket and land on her doorstep—a songbird foundling
cuckooing its misunderstood little life!”</p>

<p>There was something about these women which faintly
roused the reformer in Thurley. They were simply out
of step, she insisted, her own little feet always marching
to the bandwagon without question. They needed to be
shown the inspiration which can be gained from
mediocrity. Although they were humorous and a trifle
pathetic, they were dangerous, to Thurley’s mind.</p>

<p>“What havoc they could raise!” she said to Hobart
one afternoon. “They would be capable of playing
gnome at sane and settled doorways and calling, ‘Leave
your tasks—come out—come out,’ and a great many
would follow them. They are seething with discontent
and they have the determination which keeps them going,
yet they do not tell themselves the truth; they magnify
home wrongs and future glories and their own possibilities.
And I think,” she added with a frank smile, “they
have either never been loved by any one or else loved
some one who did not love them. It’s a form of romantic
insanity which causes them to denounce love when all
the while they crave it—insane persons always turn on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
the ones who love them best. So these dear, queer girls
and women, trying to avoid routine work and home folks,
just need to have Cupid take their telephone number and
he could accomplish the miracle of miracles.”</p>

<p>Chuckling, Hobart had taken his leave. The next
afternoon he surprised Thurley with a call, handing her
a bouquet of charming wine-colored, white-specked blossoms
surrounded by cool fern.</p>

<p>She did not thank him; instead she flushed and the
blue eyes grew two shades deeper blue.</p>

<p>“I thought you’d be terribly set up over an old-fashioned
‘bow pot.’” Hobart was rather mystified.</p>

<p>“I am; you chose cleverly.” Thurley hated herself
for betraying displeasure.</p>

<p>“Why don’t you like Early Morning Brides? They
used to be my mother’s favorite; she sent to America for
seed and we had one walk lined with them.” Hobart
looked like the small boy who had blundered into delivering
the love note to the green grocer and the green
grocer’s order to the loved one!</p>

<p>Thurley’s face had cleared magically. “Oh, is that
the name you know them by?” dimples twinkling in her
cheeks. “I—I thought it something else.”</p>

<p>“What?” determined to solve the mystery.</p>

<p>“A silly name, very likely I’m wrong—anyway,
you’re a dear and here they go into my best vase and on to
my best table!”</p>

<p>Later in the day Hobart took time to retrace his steps
to the old florist. He asked if Early Morning Brides
had ever been known by another name.</p>

<p>“Well, some do call ’em Old Maids’ Pincushion,” the
man told him, “but I’m one as has no liking for the
name!”</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII</h2>

<p>During the winter Thurley tired of the hysterical hikers,
since they increased in number. They did not bother
with such persons as Lissa or Mark or Polly. And
Hobart, who was acknowledged to be the personification
of public opinion, was immune from the pest. By degrees
Thurley realized why Lissa was not bothered—because
Lissa herself was a hysterical hiker developed to
the stage of a near-genius; such transformations are too
often wrought these days. Like recognizing like, she
was severely let alone. As for Mark—when Thurley
thought of him she found herself sitting down in a
nearby chair, deaf to the world about her. There was
no denying that if Lissa’s theories regarding artists’
privileges were true and her theories of life ethical, her
exponent of them, Mark, was a sorry example. Mark
was rapidly becoming a selfish neurasthenic; his better self
died hard, it is true, but dying it was. Although the
actress part of Thurley delighted in the unwise excitement
of a flirtation with some one else’s property, the
real Thurley looked askance at the changes being swiftly
wrought in the boy, his over-emphasis on petty detail
concerning his comfort, his ill humor at minor happenings
which were not as he had wished, his sluggishness
regarding work—the critics began to hint he was too
bulky of figure. More and more did he bask in Lissa’s
salon, drink and eat unwisely, taking her raggings about
the “so-great-nobody” with humorous unconcern, quite
positive of his own power to fascinate and offset Lissa’s
tempers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span></p>

<p>Foppish dress, lack of humdrum duties, home ties—there
had been an aunt, Thurley learned, who had raised
him and of whom he was now ashamed. She lived meekly
retired in the little white house in Connecticut and Mark
sent her money, the easiest thing in the world to send,
and her name was never mentioned. His press agent
had a most fetching story about his mother’s being a
Turkish girl who escaped from a harem and his father
a Grecian nobleman and Mark’s having been educated
in Moscow and Berlin, whereas, in the real heart of
the man, there was the spirit which could be reverent and
proud of his aunt’s toil-worn hands with prominent purplish
veins and knotted fingers, of the simple white house
and the everyday living which had given him the constitution
to endure the not-everyday living he now embraced.</p>

<p>When Thurley’s press agent had woven similar romances
concerning herself, she refused to let them appear,
saying with a simplicity worthy of an older, wiser
woman, “I am Thurley Precore, an American. You
may tell of the box-car wagon and those funny things of
my childhood and my decision not to marry but have
a career, but please do not tell what is an untruth,” at
which the press agent had elaborated these details until
they were scarcely to be recognized and printed the
story surrounded by a string of heartbroken and despairing
bachelors of every type who were wailing that
life meant nothing as long as this new <i lang="it">diva</i> had chosen a
career instead of love.</p>

<p>One March afternoon, after Thurley had created a
new furore as <i>Senta</i> in “The Flying Dutchman,” her
social engagements crowding her with a vengeance, three
things occurred the same muggy, windy day which impressed
themselves mightily on her mind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span></p>

<p>She had had Mark in for tea, clandestinely, since Lissa
was giving a musical and had invited both of them. Miss
Clergy had gone for her usual drive and Thurley had
donned corn-colored silk with silver trimmings and a
new set of cameo jewelry to exercise her powers of
fascination.</p>

<p>Ernestine was on tour and Polly Harris had temporarily
disappeared from the horizon, particularly Thurley’s,
because the latter had innocently had the bad taste to
try to help her openly. Collin was in Washington to
paint the president’s portrait and Caleb in Europe rapidly
burning up the earnings of his last year’s book.</p>

<p>The opera season was near completion and Thurley
and Miss Clergy were casting about where to spend
the summer, the press agents urging some unusual
spot which should furnish them with autumn copy—a
submarine boat or the Sahara desert! The naming of a
cigar for her and an invitation to sing at the dedication of
a great church had been the events of the week while
banners up and down Fifth Avenue announced that she
had made a record of her “Aïda” aria, “<i lang="it">O, ciel assuerri</i>”
for a prominent talking machine company. As
the loveliest and youngest singer of her day, with Europe
flirting with her managers to hear her and America
plying her with dollars to keep her at home, Thurley
wondered how it would seem to have some new pink-and-white-cheeked
girl with an even greater voice than
hers, bluer eyes and brighter hair, come slipping into
the opera field as she had done. She wondered if she
could be half as gracious as these tired-faced men and
women who welcomed and hated and pitied her all in
one!</p>

<p>She glanced sideways in a glass and added mentally,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
“You’ve a long road ahead, anyway,” while Mark
droned on in impossible platitudes.</p>

<p>A maid brought a card and Thurley read the name,
Hortense Quinby. Underneath was written, “Please
see me, very vital.”</p>

<p>“Run along, Mark,” she commanded. “You’ve told
pretty fibs long enough. Do go to Lissa’s recital. You
must stop travelling on such thin ice as long as you are determined
to be a slug.”</p>

<p>“That’s no fair.” Mark tried to take her hands but
she drew away.</p>

<p>“How do you like these cameos?” she demanded.</p>

<p>“Let me get you lovelier things. There ought to be
jewels just for you and no one else—a Thurley design
in pale gold—”</p>

<p>“Spare me! There is a front-laced Precore corset, a
Thurley ginger-ale and a Thurley Precore perfecto cigar,
as well as a Thurley perfume and vanishing cream—why
torture me any further?”</p>

<p>“Because I like you. I don’t know why I don’t say
love you,” his handsome face flushing, “but you’re not
the sort to say that to unless a chap has earned the right.
How a pair of eyes can change everything one has made
up his mind to say!”</p>

<p>“I’ll cover them with my hands,” she teased.</p>

<p>“No, they’d shine through at me—true blue always
does. So I’ll just say like—and make you admit you
return the sentiment. If it’s only liking each other,
Thurley, there’s no harm!”</p>

<p>“I like you, but I don’t approve of you,” she admitted,
“and I’d rather you didn’t come to see me when you
ought to be with Lissa.”</p>

<p>“If she had some one she liked better than me, she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
would not remember such a word as loyalty,” he began
impulsively.</p>

<p>“No fair—run along and do take some exercises.
You look aldermanic.”</p>

<p>Reluctantly, he rose. “Why see every stray female
from nowhere? I used to when I took life and art
seriously. It grew to be a bore and I never see any
one now. Even if the Jap does steal more than his
wages, I keep him because he knows how never to open
the door for any one but the laundry and the liquor
agents.”</p>

<p>“I see them because it is a novelty, as people see me
because I am one,” she said soberly. “Some day the
people and I will stop both customs.... Good-by,
Mark—my apologies to Lissa and I shall see her soon.”</p>

<p>Hortense Quinby proved to be a “hysterical hiker”—one
concluded that from her pale, rather quick face
and over-severe mode of hair-dressing. She had an
untrimmed floppy hat, a bright green walking suit that
had seen better days and a severe, gentlemanly cravat
throttling her chin. There was an attempt to have a
professional air by carrying a leather portfolio, but one
could not have told whether she was a travelling manicure
or secretary to a professor on Egyptology!</p>

<p>She was not a young woman nor was she middle-aged;
perhaps the look of discontent in her dark eyes shadowed
her really admirable features. She lost no time in making
her wants known; one could see that she had been
met with many rebuffs in similar situations and so, like
the door to door canvasser she had learned to say the
most in the least time!</p>

<p>“Miss Precore,” she began in her tense voice, artificially
accented here and there with a dash of pseudo-New York,
“I am Hortense Quinby, I live in Greenwich<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
Village, and perhaps I should say I <em>starve</em> in Greenwich
Village. I have watched your rise into fame, not
with envy but with admiration and respect. You are
young, beautiful, talented; you have the world in the
palm of your little hand. I do not ask you to be anything
unreasonable—but I do implore your help. Let
me become essential to you in some capacity—a secretary,
a housekeeper, a maid—I hold myself above no
office if it concerns the right person. I play accompaniments
fairly well—not as well as you would wish
for public appearances but for your practice-hour. I
am one of those who have failed,” here a deep-seated
sigh. “I came from a small town in the middle part
of the state about ten years ago; every one thought I
had great literary ability as well as musical. But there
was no one to help me get across—perhaps when one’s
talents are divided one is to be pitied.”</p>

<p>She said all this, scarcely pausing. Now she stopped
to breathe.</p>

<p>“Really, Miss Quinby, I have every one I need,”
Thurley said gently.</p>

<p>“But I have not,” returned Miss Quinby to her amazement.
“Be generous, lovely young thing, be generous
to us who have failed. I am not asking for fame—merely
to become associated with it.” She held out her
hands dramatically. “Do not send me back to be ground
down again!”</p>

<p>“I don’t need you,” Thurley protested, most perturbed.</p>

<p>“I need you. My life cannot be lived as are thousands
of women’s lives, bounded by the price of calico
and two weeks’ vacation in a lake cottage. I have a soul
above pots and pans—a fearless soul, capable of enduring
all things to achieve my aim. Let me be your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
inspiration—you think I could not?” The restless eyes
were dangerous and somewhat vindictive.</p>

<p>Miss Quinby proceeded to enumerate her abilities and
the capacities in which she had served. As nearly as
Thurley could understand a comic opera singer stranded
in Miss Quinby’s home town had heard her sing and
idly encouraged the girl. Some one financed the comic
opera singer on to New York and she thought no more
of the incident. Not so with Hortense Quinby. From
the moment she had been told she had “a voice” and a
“future” and “get out of this hole, my dear”—everything
in her present scheme of things had been abandoned.
She came to New York only to find the opera
singer absorbed in her own difficulties and to battle alone
with her “voice” and her “future” and her having
left “the dreadful hole.”</p>

<p>She had tried magazine work; rejection slips enough
to have papered the boarding house were the result. She
had, sadly enough, a glimmer of the divine spark which led
her on a madcap chase during which the best years of
girlhood were wasted. She became socialist and follower
of long-haired, East Side gentlemen’s magazines
which the authorities usually made a bonfire of, locking up
the long-haired gentlemen. She was prominent in visiting
them in the Tombs and giving out dangerous statements
to the press, in hopes, really, of being locked up
herself and thus appearing as a martyr. There are so
many would-be martyrs, self-inflicted benefactors of the
public. But it is sometimes as hard work to gain persecution
and as futile as the task of the men who are paid
seven dollars a day to trace the history of seven cents. So
Hortense Quinby had found it. No one listened to her
nor locked her up and admitted sob sisters to write down
her ravings in the good old-fashioned dot-and-asterisk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
style. But, great Beatrice Fairfax, this was not all
wherein she had suffered! Thurley was, by turns,
amused, bored, thoughtful and finally mentally depressed
as the recital of the past flowed on in reels.</p>

<p>She had started a paper herself, only to have it fail
in a dismal way. There was not enough of danger in it
to have the postal authorities take the matter up. She
had lived among the East Side fanatics, had been second
housemaid in a rich New Yorker’s family, hoping to
observe the scandals of the leisure class and publish
them later on. Evidently, she had been unable to divulge
glorious scandals, she had a cast off hat of one of the
daughters of the family, a decent sort of room and better
food than Greenwich Village had offered and the third day
she was kindly dismissed for general lack of qualifications.
She had tried playing accompaniments, had done china
painting, suped in Broadway comedies, had done everything
that a woman troubled by a “liberated soul” could
do and yet she had not made herself invaluable to any
one really worth the while. She wanted to attach herself
to Thurley, a sort of figurative third-rail affair, the
inspiration and strength of Thurley’s youthful self.</p>

<p>Thurley, bewildered from the outpouring and wishing
some one would come and spirit her away, weakly said
she could come in to take some dictation for correspondence
once a week or do other minor tasks.</p>

<p>“Until I prove myself essential,” insisted Miss Quinby.
“When that day comes—”</p>

<p>At which Thurley named a day and hour and wearily
rang the bell to have her shown out.</p>

<p>Hortense Quinby’s visit left her with a headache and
no zest for her supper. The opera that night was to
be “The Magic Flute,” and Thurley was at her best as
<i>Pamina</i>. She loved the rôle and rehearsals had proceeded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
in excellent fashion. But the interview with Hortense
had given her a fearful sense as to her own future.
Would she, in turn, become furtive, restless, eager to
seize upon some other new and lovely creature, with a
sort of vampirish desire to have youth by feeding on
youth?</p>

<p>She went to her room without ringing for her maid and
slipped out of her brilliant afternoon frock. She rummaged
in her clothes room crowded with new gorgeousness
until she found a rough tweed suit and a boyish hat.
Taking a swagger stick and whistling for Taffy, she wilfully
disappeared out of the apartment at just the hour
her schedule called for rest, facial massage and toasted
wafers with hot milk!</p>

<p>It was rainy, and the air was unnaturally warm, the
wind having died down. Her throat doctor would have
come after her in an ambulance had he known she was
sauntering along the river drive, pausing to look at the
blinking lights on the boats or at the dark, beautiful
uncertainty of what lay on the other shore.</p>

<p>Was she beginning to have nerves? Thurley spoke
sharply to Tally, warning him to heel her or she would
disown him. Nerves! She who had never in her life
been prey to so much as a headache, who had laughed
at throat washes and precaution against eye strain, who
audaciously cracked nuts with her firm, white teeth and
declared she did not know how it would feel to be even
a trifle indisposed!</p>

<p>Not the strain of training nor the début, the unnatural
life of the opera stage nor the atmosphere of crowds and
tired, jaded artists who knew, too well, how it felt to
be muchly indisposed had made such inroads on her
Viking-like constitution as this queer woman who bounded
in on her coquettish serenity and fairly startled a yes out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
of her. Thurley felt trip-hammer pulses beating in her
forehead. She wanted to wander on and on until the
dark became permanent and the traffic scarce and she
was dog-tired as she used to be when she was at the end
of one of her tramps with Dan and they sat under a
tree to get rested up, kissing each other a shocking number
of times ... strange this woman should so affect
her.</p>

<p>She began thinking in irregular fashion, indicative of
her tired brain, of the different persons with whom the
new life had brought close and necessary contact ...
Madame Coleno, the great Wagnerian contralto, strong
and fine by birthright but with the ungovernable temper
which caused her to turn on little Edith Hooker, the
English girl who was her lyric soprano, slapping her face
and tearing at her hair until some one interfered. She
wondered if the madhouse would be this famous woman’s
last abode. Some said she had run amuck through drink,
others heartbreak, a few whispered insanity was in the
family. Then there was Escola, the silver-throated
tenor! She shook her tired head in disapproval. Escola,
who was a merciless tyrant, cared for by his wife
as if he were an infant in arms and who rewarded her
with a new breach of promise suit as a payment! The
patient wife, an Italian peasant as every one knew, made
no protest, but continued her round of preparing mustard
footbaths and making native dishes Escola demanded,
lighting her candles before her little shrine for
her master’s success!</p>

<p>... Now it was Dan Ruffio, the bass—what an outcast
from society in Birge’s Corners he would be, openly
defiant of conventions, always storming and blustering
about, sneering at him or her who obeyed the law, ridiculing,
fond of cruel practical joking of a low calibre, loving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
no one save himself, yet appearing on the stage as
the most tender of lovers, the gentlest of patriarchs!
And when Thurley attended the first supper party given
by a famous ballet dancer, she had been genuinely and
lastingly shocked at not only the conversation but the
manners observed by all,—it was not the gluttony of
Lissa’s parties that had been in evidence but an almost
sinister fashion of wasting food and demanding bizarre,
unhealthful dishes.</p>

<p>Nor could she forget Wimple O’Horo, who had made
violent love to her and pouted when repulsed! What a
wishy-washy, unreal boor he was when one knew him
from behind the footlights, what a dashing, light hearted
cavalier he appeared when viewed on the other side!
Thurley’s lips curved in scorn as she recalled his favorite
pastime of reading aloud mash notes and the signed
names as well. Some said that he conducted a highbrow
form of blackmail when he needed extra money with
which to gamble.</p>

<p>There had been a director’s party where throwing
egg-nogs had been the chief sport, regardless of costumes;
a hundred and one such incidents and new, distressing
personalities kept recurring to Thurley as she
stood there, quite sure she was tired of it all, of even
her own deliciously decent and attractive way of spending
her first earned dollars and making the most of blue
eyes, curving scarlet lips and bright brown hair.</p>

<p>She remembered what Polly had told her regarding her
future progress.</p>

<p>“There are three steps of becoming truly mundane.
First, you buy things in a store. Next, you purchase
articles in a shop. Lastly, you acquire treasures in an
establishment!”</p>

<p>With a sense of disappointment at having nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
which she might anticipate, Thurley realized she had
reached the last stage. Only yesterday she had “acquired”
a tapestry treasure from a haughty “establishment,”
the proprietor bowing her in and out with
formal regard!</p>

<p>She leaned over a stone parapet, gazing at the fog,
the occasional rain drops making her cheeks cool and
refreshed, although Taffy crouched unwillingly beside
her and wondered why this adorable but unreasonable
mistress of his walked through mud when her car waited
for her signal, to say nothing of his own self being hideously
bespotted and, therefore, in line for odious bathing.</p>

<p>Some one jostled near her, looked at her sharply for
a moment and then said in an alarmed tone,</p>

<p>“My dear little girl, what a risk on such a night!
Not an hour before you’re due in your dressing-room—tell
me, what is it?”</p>

<p>It was Bliss Hobart in an equally grotesque get-up,
a checkered raincoat and hat winning him the title of
Mackintosh of Mackintosh.</p>

<p>Thurley turned and held out her hands, the swagger
stick falling with an unjust thump on Taffy’s long-suffering
back.</p>

<p>“I’m so glad—I’m lonesome and queer. I need to
be set right,” she protested so wistfully that Hobart
kept holding on to her hands, the darkness keeping her
from spying how tender an expression was in his eyes.</p>

<p>“What’s it all about? I’ve just run out of secrets,
so do tell me. Let’s walk on, not stand in this damp.
Let me see your boots—are they stout enough?
Stand under this lamplight until I disprove your fib—ah-ha,
they are <em>not</em> stout enough. I shall call a cab.”</p>

<p>“Please don’t. I’ll run away and you’ll have to drive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
Taffy about. I must walk or I cannot sing to-night—I
want to walk miles and miles—”</p>

<p>“They’ll miss you and be throwing a scare into Gasoti
that you’ve been kidnapped. It’s ‘The Magic Flute,’
too, one of your best ... please, Thurley, just walk
along until you’ve told me the worst and then we’ll get a
cab—”</p>

<p>“What of yourself?” she asked, suddenly feeling
elated and quite fit.</p>

<p>He halfway unbuttoned his coat, showing an expanse
of white shirt bosom. “Full dress for a banquet at
which I’m to speak. I took a turn along here to get
myself in trim ... tell me, what about your fancies?”</p>

<p>Thurley’s eyes were like stars. She caught hold of
his arm as if he had been Dan and began to talk. It
seemed the most wonderful yet natural thing in the
world to tell him everything. The harsh critic, the impersonal
man of affairs vanished; he was a good pal
walking unselfishly in the rain and under such self-sacrificing
conditions that it would be an unusual woman
who could not furnish him with a complete line of new
secrets!</p>

<p>When she finished, having begun with Mark’s flirtation
and her own hint of nerves and ending with this
Hortense Quinby and the muddle she was in about the
morals of the “songbirds,” Hobart said with a jolly
laugh that set her nerves quite right,</p>

<p>“When you get jammed, always remember the most
delectable sport in the world is to let fools take you for
an even greater fool. As I told you many months ago,
be yourself and everything swings into line. Come over
to-morrow at ten; there are one or two flaws in your
‘Rigoletto’ song, ‘Caro Nome’—didn’t know I kept
such close track of some one, did you?... Hi, cabby—yes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
no, just the lady and the terrier, the Terror will
proceed alone, but twice as happy because he paused
before a certain dark outline ... good-by, to-morrow at
ten and, remember, stouter boots the next time it rains.”</p>

<p>With a feeling of disappointment that he did not join
her, yet exhilarated and impatient for the morning, Thurley
leaned back in the cab and hugged the aggrieved
Taffy.</p>

<p>She sang so well that night the critics bemoaned the
lack of new adjectives with which to do her credit, her
dressing-room was crowded with visitors, social leaders
who had left their boxes to besiege her with invitations.
Miss Clergy sat supreme in a corner of the dressing-room,
engrossed in old-style crewel work which she had
learned as a girl.</p>

<p>“And no man will ever break your heart,” she said
in fond delusion.</p>

<p>Thurley vanished. During the entire opera she had
thought of the fact that Bliss Hobart really worried because
she had not worn stouter boots ... it was so
“comfy” to know some one worried about such things.
If only the men who thought ahead about all the little
things for a woman were not so universally inclined to
forbid a woman’s thinking ahead about the big ones....</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>

<p>When spring convinced Birge’s Corners it had come
to stay and housewives mended screens and painted porch
steps, and indulged in that blight on civilization, house-cleaning,
there came a better, finer understanding between
Dan and Lorraine.</p>

<p>Since their New York wedding journey with Thurley
Precore’s début the really great event, there had been
a constrained sort of relationship. When two persons
admit to themselves they are not happy and it was a
mistake to have married, yet are making the best of it and
trying to trick the world into thinking them the personification
of bliss, the relationship is more hopeless than
if each jogs on his own way admitting his discontent and
lack of satisfaction. The latter course contains a ray
of hope in the fact that systematic deceit and repression
have not yet obtained a clutch.</p>

<p>But Dan and Lorraine had returned to the wonderful
new house and, in a pathetic, truthful talk, realized
that all life stretched before them in unending monotony
unless they wished that much dreaded and unusual of
happenings in Birge’s Corners—especially for a minister’s
daughter—a divorce!</p>

<p>“Perhaps I did wrong to marry you,” Dan said, the
first day of their return. “The Birge temper in a new
fashion. I wanted to hurt some one else because I was
hurt ... a pretty cheap way to do, wasn’t it?”</p>

<p>They were in the living-room where wedding presents
were in huddled groups, for Lorraine brooked no interference
such as a “settler” to which many brides are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
subjected. Everything was shiny new, unbecomingly
so; the rugs were scarcely adjusted to the slippery
floors, there was an air of dampness because the initial
furnace fire was scarcely under headway, price marks
were still pasted on the electric fixtures, there was something
yet to be done with the landing baseboard as there
always is something to be done after one has moved into
the supposedly most complete house in the world.</p>

<p>No evidence of family life had been introduced into
this new and loveless house which was at once the envy
and curiosity of the village. Their trunks were unpacked
in the front bedroom; the sun parlor waited
for Lorraine’s taste in furnishing; a thousand and one
details which Dan had dreamed that Thurley would
settle with her rapturous enthusiasm now awaited Lorraine’s
common sense commands. Lorraine suggested
nothing of the girl to Dan; she was a woman, narrow in
viewpoint and her comprehensions, pretty in a doll sense,
without imagination or artistic taste, some one who would
do her share in the hill climbing, who would keep house
to the degree of dusting even the tops of the window
ledges where no one possibly could look for dust without
the aid of a stepladder, but guiltless of exuberance
of youth and love of romance.</p>

<p>“I knew you always loved Thurley,” Lorraine answered
fearlessly. “You knew I always loved you. If
Thurley would not marry you and you asked me in her
stead, I felt that you would better be married. You
might have done some ugly, cheap things, Dan, if you
had not been engaged to me. I love you enough to make
myself—content, by keeping your house and having your
name. I know I’m not Thurley,” she smiled wistfully,
“but I’ll always be Lorraine. Some day you may come
to care a little more.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, ’Raine, you care as much as that?”</p>

<p>“I can’t say it as I’d like,” was her answer.</p>

<p>Dan had gone over to take her gently in his arms.
“I’m not good enough for you,” he mumbled, laying his
head on her shoulder for a long, silent moment.</p>

<p>Nothing more was said, no mention made of the wild-rose
siren who shadowed their happiness. Each understood
life was to go on in even fashion. Lorraine would
gain her joy and satisfaction from being Dan’s wife, with
the pleasure of possessions; she was born to be a housewife
and would have been depressed and useless in any
other channel. Dan was born to dominate, to be successful
in whatsoever he undertook, tyrannical, aggressive,
honest and without fear. Dan would find his peace of
mind in his business, more and more engrossed in it each
month, in the town’s development. Each impersonally
would be able to endure the strain of personal unhappiness.</p>

<p>To be able to entertain all the social clubs in the big,
sunny parlors with over-stuffed tapestry furniture, the
baby grand player, three parlor lamps, a large engraving
of “Daniel in the Lion’s Den,” to say nothing of the
American oriental rugs and the mahogany grandfather’s
clock that played the Canterbury quarters—that was a
genuine satisfaction to Lorraine Birge. True, she would
have been more happy as the loved wife of Dan Birge,
even had they lived as did his rumored ancestor—a
trapper’s roving, wild life. But that not being the case,
Lorraine had the convenient ability to transfer her happiness
into things, into becoming a hospitable young matron
who followed conventional ways with amusing docility.</p>

<p>To have chicken salad made of real chicken and not a
hint of veal, coffee with endless whipped cream and loaf<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
sugar, fresh peach ice cream and angel food for the refreshment
of her Bible class was a positive joy to Lorraine;
to be able to help Mary How, the girl who had
been “unfortunate,” was a greater joy; to see that the
struggling little church had a new carpet and a leather
upholstered chair for the minister, to give a set of new
anthems to the choir—such things as these dulled the
doubts in her heart.</p>

<p>“She must be happy and he must be glad he married
her,” was the consensus of opinion. “She spends as
much as a queen and Sunday she had on the fourth new
dress since she came home a bride, to say nothing of
hats.”</p>

<p>“Dan Birge give her pa an overcoat with real Astrakhan
collar and cuffs on it and you never see him now
without he’s got a cigar stuck in his mouth—do you
think it looks well for a minister? Some say they don’t
like it. Lorraine’s got a la va-leer necklace and a bracelet
watch and a diamond ring besides her engagement ring
and she hires a woman to wash and clean.... She better
go slow or the money will build her right up. I remember
how she washed every mite of clothes she and her
pa had.”</p>

<p>“What about their electric cleaner, that’s pretty high-toned?
And she had finger bowls, yes, finger bowls when
the out-of-town men took dinner there. Ali Baba says
they’re going to buy a seven-passenger car—of course
it’s nobody’s business and they certainly do a lot of good
but they better be careful or they will find themselves
so up in G that there would be no living with them ...
my Milly says Dan Birge is going to make his clerks
wear black dresses with white collars—now did you
ever! I guess Lia Fine and Mercedes Rains won’t. Lia
just got herself a red alpaca made with white braid—now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
what does Dan want to go and do such things
for?”</p>

<p>“I dunno, anybody that wanted to marry Thurley Precore
is likely to try ’most anything,” the subject here
changing to Thurley and her rumored fame, the great
event concerning Abby Clergy’s recovery and adoption
of Thurley.</p>

<p>So Dan and Lorraine developed a pleasant politeness
in their personal relationships as if they had been married
a great many years and, perforce, discovered that to be
polite was the easiest way to proceed!</p>

<p>Nor would it be quite fair to say that, in time, Dan
did not become used to his well ordered home and excellent
meals, cooked to please himself first and others
afterwards, the even-tempered, pretty wife who always
smiled when he smiled and who would absent herself
whenever she suspected that he wanted to be alone, to
rummage in the den in masculine disorder, using a cushion
for his feet as well as his head or to go into the pantry
in trail of half a pie and ruthlessly crumb the parlor
rugs while he ate it, listening to his favorite rag-time roll
on the player piano. Dan was unconscious of the
heinous offense committed, because no complaint was
ever made. So surely as Lorraine knew that Thurley
ruled in her husband’s heart, so surely did Dan rule in
Lorraine’s heart, and she had schooled herself in ways
of becoming essential to his comfort if not to his affections.</p>

<p>Dan’s clothes were mended, never a rip nor tear nor
missing button was in evidence. If he was late for dinner,
“It keeps warm so nicely in that jewel of an oven,”
or if he ’phoned at the last moment that he would not be
home, the telephone operator, June Myers, was forced
to report that Lorraine said as sweetly as if she was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
being asked to a party, “Oh, surely, Dan, I understand—well,
have a good time, won’t you?”</p>

<p>“Little mother-drudge” was Ali Baba’s name for her
when he and Betsey would argue with Hopeful as to the
situation. Hopeful, true to her name, tried to convince
herself and every one else that joy reigned in the new
house with the iron deer guarding the grass plot, that
things were better as they were. But Ali Baba and
Betsey gave battle that Thurley was the girl Dan loved
and Lorraine was merely making the best of it.</p>

<p>They “went out” as befitted young married people
and entertained in turn. But Dan paid no heed to Lorraine’s
friends. Perhaps he was conscious of their
thoughts. He managed to stay away whenever Lorraine
had in “a bunch” and when they attended dancing parties
or automobile picnics, he always left the women and
drifted with the men to smoke or talk business even when
the men would have chosen to play a little.</p>

<p>Dan was determined to keep up the deceit to himself
as much as to Lorraine. He gave her all she asked for—but
he never thought of a surprise, a reward, a consolation
posy when rain prevented a drive or a bruised
finger was the result of trying to hammer a nail in
straight. None of the tender trifles fell to her lot.
And the old, fiery Dan, who was “bound to be hung,”
as the village had prophesied, went his way in his
own fashion, brooking neither interference nor questioning.</p>

<p>When the new and high-priced talking machine was
sent up to the house the day before Christmas, Lorraine
had hesitated before she read the titles of the records.
She fully expected to see “Sung by Thurley Precore”
on the greater share of them. But Dan had chosen with
stoic consideration and Thurley’s voice was never recreated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
to fill their rooms with glorious but unwelcome
sound.</p>

<p>Nor did any one mention Thurley to Dan. A few of
the old-timers would say when occasion offered, “You
got a pretty fine little wife,” and Dan would nod cheerfully
and answer,</p>

<p>“Bet I have!” And here the matter ended.</p>

<p>Once, Lorraine’s father, who had wisely chosen to
live apart from his son-in-law’s splendor, called on Lorraine
during Dan’s absence out of town and said in his
slow way,</p>

<p>“Well, my girl, have you anything to tell me?”</p>

<p>Lorraine was engaged in making “over-drapes” for
the spare room which was to be in pink. She was the
sort who could smother a heartache in making over-drapes
and planning color schemes as reflected in candle-shades,
braided rugs and embroidered bed-shams.</p>

<p>“Tell you what, father?” she did not look at him.</p>

<p>“Is he happy?” the old man added, which surprised
her for she thought he would have asked if she was
happy.</p>

<p>“I hope so,” she told him, laying aside the over-drapes.</p>

<p>“You’re a good girl, Lorraine, and you are doing your
part. If God sees fit, some day you will be happy,
too.”</p>

<p>They said no more about the matter. After he left
and Lorraine, like all wives whose husbands are out of
town, was eating her cold lunch off the kitchen table, she
neglected her meal to wonder about the prophecy. It
seemed to her, rank little atheist, that it was not God
who was to see fit half as much as a girl named Thurley
Precore!</p>

<p>When Dan returned—he had been in New York—she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
wondered if he had heard Thurley sing and had sent
her flowers or tried to see her. As she thanked him for
her present, a violet silk sunshade, she wondered if it
was a sop to conscience. A cruel regiment of doubts
threatened to defeat her loyal resolutions. But she made
no comment nor did Dan. They talked of the summer
garden, the proposed automobile trip with some other
young people, the addition to Dan’s store and the splendid
way in which his business was going.</p>

<p>“Don’t, for cat’s sake, take that Spooner girl with
us!” Dan said testily, as they returned to the vacation
subject. “She hangs around here all the time. What
in the world do you see in her anyway?”</p>

<p>“Nothing, but I’m sorry for her, she’s so unhappy.”</p>

<p>“What’s she unhappy about? A great, big, strapping
girl who ought to be at work! She makes fudge
while her mother irons her dresses, every one says
so.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Dan!” pleaded Lorraine.</p>

<p>“Ever since she’s moved here from Pike she has
camped on our doorstep. She makes me nervous with
that whining voice and that giggle.” Here Dan gave excellent
imitations of each. “She rouges like a burlesque
actress and dresses her hair in curls.”</p>

<p>“Oh, poor Cora Spooner was terribly in love with an
actor. He was in a stock company at Pike and he did
encourage her—”</p>

<p>“Tell that to the marines,” Dan said testily, going
to the talking machine and putting on a lively band
record. “I can’t help that. I notice it didn’t affect
her appetite. Why don’t she get a job?”</p>

<p>“Well, there’s nothing in her line here,” Lorraine’s
forehead wrinkled anxiously. She was afraid Dan would
forbid Cora’s coming to the house, which command would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
be absolute. Cora Spooner brought a certain zest into
Lorraine’s existence. She was a rather handsome girl
of twenty-three or four with no intention of working for
her living if it could be otherwise arranged. Her
mother, whose small pension and capital enabled her to
“get along,” was Cora’s chief bugbear. Cora was a
bundle of discontent and weird notions, trying to play
the bird in the gilded cage rôle and complain that Birge’s
Corners was nothing but a prison. She soon discovered
that Lorraine’s car was good to ride about in, her food
the best to be had; it was jolly to stay in the pink spare
room with the over-drapes and crystal candlesticks instead
of her own forlorn cottage. Besides, her mother
did not understand her; fancy wanting any one to be a
stenographer or school teacher when heaven only knew
that Cora was born for romance, adventure! She had a
good notion to cut her hair short and masquerade about
the country as a boy,—men always had such good times.
Cora had had a half dozen beaux who always dropped
her after a certain length of time, saying she was “soft”
and lazy and her mother ought to make her work, and
turning their attentions to plain-faced girls who could
cook and who had a little money in the bank!</p>

<p>Cora dressed in the extreme of fashion, badgering Dan
for advance style sheets and asking him to order things
for her for which she could not pay, wearing them about
with a selfconscious mannikin air. When orange silk
stockings and white kid boots were the vogue, Cora
stepped forth in the most blazing of orange stockings
and the snowiest of white kid boots, her skirts just
reaching below the knee. When the matter was mentioned
to her mother, she said with a weak smirk that
Cora was her pa all over again. Every one said if she
could have the training she would make a great actress.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span></p>

<p>Birge’s Corners, having had one genius develop in its
humble and unappreciative midst, frowned upon this suggestion—it
is not always the most pleasing nor convenient
event to have a genius arise from one’s backyard!</p>

<p>“I guess Cora will marry well,” Mrs. Spooner used
to say, “so I don’t mind doing the work and keeping
her hands white—have you ever noticed them? Dear
me, I should think Mrs. Birge would keep a maid instead
of slaving so. Cora says she works like a little Turk.
They say he has a lot of money.... I wish there were
some brothers in his family.”</p>

<p>So Cora went her selfish way, awaiting the arrival of a
rich bachelor who was to besiege her with attentions.
She used to prey on Lorraine’s sympathy and lack of experience
by her tales of being misunderstood and abused.
Cora was shrewd in shallow fashion, highly emotional,
jealous, small-minded and given to extreme views of anything
which happened to appeal to her for the moment.
She was a bad asset to the village since she could arouse
discontent and rebellion quickly among her associates.
She had a way of unsettling every one and then withdrawing
from the situation without leaving a solution.</p>

<p>The neighbors said she raged and fought with her
mother over the question of money and that she always
came out victor. In public, she was devotion itself,
although she was ashamed of her mother’s appearance
and managed to keep her in the house most of the time.
“Mamma has heart trouble” was her tender explanation,
although mamma was probably ironing ruffled petticoats
or cleaning white kid boots at the very moment
Cora pensively explained the maternal maladies!</p>

<p>Lorraine regarded Cora as a story-book sort of person,
marvelling at her daring and style. Cora openly
had tried to bewitch Dan and, being curtly shown she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
was of no more consequence than Mr. Toots, began systematically
and painstakingly to “knock” him to every
one except his wife.</p>

<p>“Poor little Lorraine—little slave, she is—I go to
see her because I’m so sorry for her, yes, he’s terribly
mean—oh, <em>awful</em>! I’ve heard some things, but of
course it wouldn’t be right to repeat them,” and so on,
all the time borrowing Lorraine’s pin money and eating
up her dinners, riding in her car and making Lorraine introduce
her to every man, married or unmarried, who
stopped over in the village long enough to visit the
Birges.</p>

<p>Lorraine did not press the matter of taking Cora on
the vacation, although Cora had managed to invite herself!</p>

<p>“There is melancholia in our family,” she told Lorraine.
“Oh, yes, several suicides—terrible, isn’t it?
I try not to brood but I am a daughter of the sun, I
crave love and life. How could I be content in this
pokey place? Oh, Lorraine, I look upon you as a sister—do
be good to me,” at which Lorraine’s gullible little
self would be utterly won over and she would bake Cora’s
favorite cake and make her a crêpe de chine waist and
ask over, braving Dan’s wrath, some drummer who might
be in search of a wife as well as a buyer for his dustless
mops!</p>

<p>But there was another person who had come into The
Corners since Thurley had left it and whom Dan regarded
as every one’s enemy. He had said publicly that it was
a patriotic duty to have this person, Owen Pringle, although
he spelled it Oweyne and had a book plate, shot
at sunrise, velvet smoking-jacket, hair parted in the
middle and all!</p>

<p>As the record ended, Dan flung himself on the sofa,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
remarking, “I wish Cora and Owen would get married—ye
gods, do you get it?” He chuckled. “I’d hand
them a chest of small silver if they did. How about it—can’t
you get Owen interested?”</p>

<p>“Oh, Cora wouldn’t consider him,” Lorraine said
seriously.</p>

<p>Dan chuckled more than ever. “If you had a sense
of humor, you’d have a lot of fun, but you take these
people at face value. Now Owen clerked for me a
month and disorganized the whole shop. I’ll tell you
right now that unless he cuts out his nonsense and goes
back to the livery stable from which he sprang, I’m
going to get him away from here.”</p>

<p>“But his shop is artistic,” Lorraine murmured.</p>

<p>At which Dan tossed a sofa pillow good-naturedly her
way. He proceeded, in his slangy fashion, to tell her
that this Owen Pringle who had appeared from nowhere
some months before and tried his best to create a real,
true leisure class in the village was nothing short of several
kinds of a fool; that when a full-grown man with apparently
nothing the matter with him tries to make his
living by starting a shop and spelling it shoppe, and has
a wistaria tea room and an art department where you
purchase impossible penwipers made of cherry-colored
silk, baby bootees and old ladies’ knitted throws, smart
Christmas cards telling about everything but Christmas,
and writing paper that resembled butchers’ wrappings,
as well as crazy old wooden stuff painted bright red and
green and labelled “window ledges” or “door stops”
<em>and</em>, horror of horrors, a millinery department which
this Oweyne conducted himself, making hats resembling
Weber and Fields,—it is time to employ violence! But
this was not the worst of his offenses. Oh, no—he
had tried to organize a country club and persuade hard-working,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
honest men to play golf instead of raising potatoes
and instituted the polo craze, thereby demoralizing
all the decent, well-broken delivery horses in the
township. He lived at Dan’s old suite at the Hotel
Button and gave chafing-dish parties and thought up
smart sayings ahead of time. He wanted to organize
a stock company and play “Lady Windermere’s Fan,” but
Cora Spooner and June Meyers were the only two who
had out and out joined, so the project was abandoned
“for lack of funds and interest.”</p>

<p>Owen always wore Palm Beach suits and hats draped
with Roman scarfs. He was given to a dash of garlic in
his salad dressing, believed the dead returned, read
French novels and was undeniably seen sitting in the
window of his shoppe sewing maline on hat frames and
actually trying them on himself for the effect.</p>

<p>At first he was a novelty, but since tea and nasturtium-leaf
sandwiches do not appeal to the male population,
only females clustered together in his shoppe and bought
his nonsense or defended him.</p>

<p>Owen, too, had speedily discovered the advantage of
having Mrs. Daniel Birge as a patroness. Despite Dan’s
ridicule, she came to the shoppe to buy a hat and thus
set the stride for the younger set, while Owen managed
to be invited to dinner and to be present on the most
interesting of the automobile trips.</p>

<p>“As a member of the idle rich, Owen would have
shone,” concluded Dan, “but in life his best getaway
would be to become president of the Erie Canal.” Then
seeing Lorraine’s real confusion, he said good-naturedly,
“If they amuse you, go on, honey, drag the whole lot
up here—you have to listen to them,” drifting into an
unsociable nap and leaving Lorraine occupied with her
thoughts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span></p>

<p>Dan’s other two particular pests and Lorraine’s friends
were Josie Donaldson and Hazel Mitchell. Josie
Donaldson’s father was next to Dan the richest man in
the village and Josie the natural and fearful result of being
the only child of such a plutocrat.</p>

<p>She was a precocious young person with the boast that
she could do anything she set out to do, if she could do
it her way, backed up by admiring throngs of relatives.
She had framed the first dollar bill she ever earned (?)
for some minor service in her father’s hardware store,
had worn the patience of the newspaper editors to a
thread by asking for a job as a reporter only to take a
few days off, after she was hired, to give a party or write
a new poem. Dan called her poems “Josie’s dope,” as
they appeared from time to time in a box border with
the heading, “Birge’s Corners’ Muse.”</p>

<p>There were many familiar phrases in these poems
which increased in number as time went on, but being
Josie Donaldson’s, they were passed without question and
editor after editor would warn his new and optimistic successor,
“When that Donaldson girl comes in here for a
job just tie the can on from the start. It is cheap at half
the price to be rid of her. You’ll know her. She’s fat
and dresses like a circus rider, carries a bolt of baby ribbon
around so as to tie up any poems she may happen to
write en route. She’ll cry if you correct her spelling and
she was never known to get any one’s initials right in her
life, not even her own family’s. Fudge ought to be her
life work. She’s made love to every fellow in the burg
and, when they escape, she wants to start a backbiting contest
in the paper. Her pa and ma think Josie is one, two,
three, all right, and they have enlarged photographs of
her at every stage—from writhing on the fur rug clad in
a smile to her graduating dress clasping the valedictory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
essay. She writes her father’s ads and I’m darned if I
can tell whether he wants to run a special sale of sprinkling
cans at seventy-nine cents per or whether hell’s
broken loose in Hoboken! Don’t let her get across—not
even for a week or you’ll have galloping brain fever.”</p>

<p>Josie also attached herself to Lorraine, who read her
poems and made her fudge galore. She told Lorraine
her troubles, that a girl with brains, and particularly a
girl with literary ability, was never popular with boys;
they wanted silly, little wasp-waisted dolls and she was
just too hurt for words—so there.</p>

<p>Lorraine was also sorry for Josie and she let her
ravage her sugar barrel and pile on to her best chaise
longue to lie and pout and eat candy, trying to find a new
word to rhyme with “death.”</p>

<p>The other offender was Dan’s own stenographer,
Hazel Mitchell. Dan, who looked upon the world with
a larger vision than did most of the Corners, had a contempt
and lack of interest in Lorraine’s “grafters.”
Had he loved Lorraine as he had loved Thurley there
would have been many a battle on the subject until he had
shown Lorraine the broader vision and comprehension.
As it was, he was content to let well enough alone, unless
he was called upon to entertain the “grafters” and endure
their chatter.</p>

<p>Hazel Mitchell was a slender, wan-eyed girl—“moon
face” was Dan’s considerate name for her. She was,
so he said, eternally recombing her hair when he wanted
to give some dictation and always feeling whether or not
her waist and skirt were properly interlocked, or running
off to visit the male clerk in the men’s furnishings or
“just slipping” up to Owen Pringle’s shoppe to try on a
new hat!</p>

<p>Hazel operated her actions on the theory that “pity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
is akin to love” and if she could make every one sufficiently
sorry for her the day was won. This she managed
to do with less consideration for the truth and the
common sense of her audience than one might have suspected.</p>

<p>“Oh, I never listen to her yarns,” Dan told Lorraine,
when Lorraine asked if he did not feel sorry for Hazel
who had a brutal, drunken father and whose mother
with eight children younger than Hazel never had a kind
word for the girl, but expected her to come right straight
home from work and start tending the babies. “If there
was any one else in this town I could hire, I’d do it without
hesitation. But if I let her go, Josie Donaldson
would want the place or else Cora Spooner, and Hazel is
a mild sort of fool. How can she cry all the time and
not get granulated lids?” he ended irritably. “She blots
her dictation pad for fair.”</p>

<p>“She says they have nothing elevating in their home
and she craves better things,” repeated little Lorraine.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, she does—she wants a duke to drop out of
the clouds and swoop her up and a lot she cares if her
whole family starve to death. I don’t blame her father
for his morning’s morning, if he has to listen to her, and
she spends all her money on herself, turning it right into
the store for nonsense. Her spare time she spends in
Owen Pringle’s boudoir,” Dan’s eyes twinkled, “learning
how to be one of the idle rich on eight per! Oh, ’Raine,
ask old Ali Baba up for supper—I want to know how it
feels to have somebody with sense as a guest.”</p>

<p>“But it’s a real joy for the girls to come here—”</p>

<p>Here Dan betrayed more insight into Lorraine’s life
than she fancied he possessed. “It was never a joy for
them to come and see you when you lived at the parsonage,
scrubbing and cooking and mending! I never saw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
Josie Donaldson rolling up her sleeves to give you a lift
or Hazel Mitchell hanging about until she was asked inside.
It was no joy then. They beat it the other way
when they saw you coming—”</p>

<p>He spied a tear in Lorraine’s gentle eyes. So he humbly
added, “Never mind my growls, do as you like—you
don’t dictate to me about the grafters I take to lunch or
driving, do you?”</p>

<p>Lorraine did not answer; she was thinking that Dan,
too, was quite in the same category. Dan had never had
any “joy” in seeing Lorraine until Thurley had gone
away. Dan was no different in some respects from the
others!</p>

<p>Before the vacation occurred, with Owen, Josie and
Cora as the guests, Lorraine rummaged in Dan’s chiffonier
to find extra goggles for Cora and a linen motor
coat for Owen. She came upon a magazine lying face
downward.</p>

<p>She understood why it was almost hidden, for it was a
recent issue of a musical journal and the cover page was
a brilliant color reproduction of a photograph of Thurley
Precore as <i>Aïda</i>, glowing praise briefly written underneath.
Thurley wore a mesh of lace studded with brilliants;
she half reclined on a divan, like some legendary
queen dreaming in the blue-black night!</p>

<p>Lorraine did not know how long she had been crouching
on the floor as if she were a child discovering hidden
Christmas presents. Dan came in and, bending down,
gently took the magazine away. Lorraine started up.
She realized the contrast between the photograph and
herself far more than Dan—since Dan only realized
Thurley. Her bungalow apron over a pink house dress,
her heelless slippers, her unpowdered, flushed face—and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
that gorgeous, super-person smiling out so temptingly at
them both!</p>

<p>“’Raine, do you mind—just having the picture?” he
asked with none of his customary aggression.</p>

<p>“Why, no—of course not.” She was glad to make
her escape.</p>

<p>That night Dan brought his wife some roses and told
her she had on a becoming dress; he was glad Cora
Spooner was to be Owen’s clerk—after all, it took all
kinds of fools to make a world.</p>

<p>And on the same night Thurley, closing her season,
received among other offerings a handsome basket of
orchids and lilies tied with silvery tulle. The card said,
“From an old friend.”</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>

<p>Thurley’s summer was spent unwisely. She excused
this by apparently sound reasons. First, she was tired
from the season’s work and the unusual social demands
which it seemed wisest to endure. Secondly, her jealous
curiosity was roused at Bliss Hobart’s mysterious departure
without explanation of where he was going or
how long he would remain away, an almost brusque leave-taking
which consisted of a brief cup of tea at Thurley’s
apartment, telling her some critical things about her voice
and answering lightly when she questioned him as to his
whereabouts,</p>

<p>“I go to my castle in Spain, really, nothing but a simple
little hermitage in the Maine woods. I assure you it
would be of no interest. Now I must be off, for it is
like uprooting an oak every time I go away. I like to
leave things as shipshape as possible before I begin to
play.”</p>

<p>“Are you never lonesome?” she persisted.</p>

<p>“I’ve all the inhabitants of the forest,” he answered.
“Good-by. I understand you’ve accepted for the yachting
party, the one Lissa is giving.” His face expressed
displeasure.</p>

<p>Thurley nodded; she had intended to escape it until
this identical moment when his bland, impersonal manner
was fuel for her folly.</p>

<p>“You’ll get good ideas as to what to avoid. I have
always contended that to build a virtuous wall around
one’s self was questionable,—better be able to view all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
that is happening, good and bad, and make one’s deductions
accordingly. Lissa reminds me of the basilisk
serpent who could ‘look one to death.’ Have a care,
Thurley; you’ve no more youth and energy to spare than
most of us.” And he left her.</p>

<p>The third reason, and this, too, was an annoying secret,
was that Thurley wanted to see the Boston Valley hills
and Birge’s Corners. She wanted to go home! Yet
not as Thurley Precore, prima donna, but just as Thurley,
as unknown but as loved as when she had raced through
the village with Dan in pursuit or climbed chestnut trees
to the discredit of her manners, helping make daisy
chains for the primary class to carry into church on Children’s
Day or working her bit of a garden with wholehearted
interest and disregard of her appearance.</p>

<p>The notion was absurd and impossible, and, as a powerful
destroyer of whim, Thurley accepted the invitation
to Lissa’s yachting party and cruised along the coast of
Newfoundland in a yacht which had been lent to Lissa
by one of her devoted pupils.</p>

<p>The yachting party was not a pleasant affair all told.
But it was interesting and exciting. Lissa herself was
the discordant note, with the faculty of stirring every
one up about something and then losing interest in it and
being provoked if the others did not play sheep and do
likewise. She had a subtle fashion of reminding every
one that, after all, she was the hostess and if they wished
they could all get off the yacht at any time they liked and
walk home from Newfoundland!</p>

<p>Lissa played with Mark in cat-and-mouse fashion,
flirted desperately with Caleb to arouse Ernestine’s jealousy,
and Caleb, who regarded her as stunning copy, resolved
to transplant her bodily in her most daring combination
of orange satin with black velvet streamers into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
his next best seller. There were ways of gaining revenge,
he informed Ernestine, who stayed by herself on
the upper deck, dressing in uninteresting smock affairs
and talking over prosy matters with Collin Hedley and
Polly, while Thurley and Mark romped about to brave
Lissa’s displeasure as they made pseudo-love in audacious
fashion.</p>

<p>After four weeks of this vapid sport, every one had
succeeded in getting on every one else’s nerves and the
party disbanded, its members each vowing that, although
so and so was a dear, they would never go away with
them again, and Thurley flew on to the mountains to
visit Miss Clergy and find an enforced peace in the sanitarium
routine.</p>

<p>War broke out in Europe with its astonishing effects
and complications and when the fall came to rescue Thurley
from feeling as aged as the gentleman from Calcutta
who had chronic neuralgia and had occupied the veranda
chair next to Miss Clergy’s, New York began to hum with
winter plans and she returned to Hortense and the apartment
with positive delight and eagerness.</p>

<p>Ennui in the young is more deadly than in the middle-aged,
since it is an unnatural happening. The press
agent who wrote attractive squibs about Miss Precore
yachting and in the mountains little dreamed that Thurley
started her season with as much zest as the squirrel
in the squirrel cage who, from his endless pursuit of nothing,
seems to be the proof extraordinary to the world
that it is possible for one person to make a quarrel!</p>

<p>Ernestine Christian had romped over to Devonshire
to meet a congenial friend who would wheel through the
country and thus repay her for the yachting trip, but she
was caught in the war clouds and reached home with difficulty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span></p>

<p>Caleb met her as was customary, although all she said
by way of a welcome was,</p>

<p>“I’ve had a fright of a time. Europe is seething like
a witches’ caldron. I’m out of my own cigarettes and
special kind of hair nets and my fingers feel like sticks.
Dalrymple, the best coach I’ve ever had, has rushed to
Canada to go into training!”</p>

<p>“You look fagged,” Caleb admitted as he drove her
home. “Well, as nearly as I can make out every one
has a grouch on. Thurley is beginning to have bad mannerisms;
Bliss must take her in hand. Lissa has ruined
her with nonsensical notions and Mark dawdles about
only to waste her time. You haven’t asked as to myself,”
he reminded her childishly.</p>

<p>“I brought you a hand-illumined thing,” she answered.</p>

<p>“Oh, certainly—always remember the servants when
returning home. It pays! By Jove, that’s a nice hullo
for a chap, to say nothing of having stood for your
glooms in Newfoundland—”</p>

<p>“You were listening behind tall vases to get our conversation,”
she reproached. “I dare say you’ve a hundred
pages’ getaway on a worst-seller.”</p>

<p>Caleb was silent and then, instead of impetuous defense,
he said in a dreary tone, “Don’t believe I’ll bother
you again, Ernestine. It just ‘riles’ you and discourages
me.”</p>

<p>“Oh, do drop in for dominoes; no one else ever lets
me win so often,” she returned, a bundle of nerves and
womanish imaginings, prepared to enter her apartment
and find fault and be adorably generous all in one.</p>

<p>Caleb was right concerning Thurley’s mannerisms.
Her first adverse criticism proved a mental stab at which
she recoiled with agonizing and amusing self-excuses.</p>

<p>“Miss Precore has adopted an unpleasant habit of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
swaying her body when her voice ascends the scale.
Hitherto one of the greatest delights of this young artist
was the splendid simplicity which charmed every one who
heard and saw her. Not for an instant did she forget
the great essentials of musical art—to conceal art itself.
She was as unconscious of the audience or the opera company
as if she were, in truth, the composer’s mental vision
when actually writing the title part! It is to be hoped
that this habit and the air of self-consciousness may be
done away with before either becomes fixed. To lose
such an example of artistic triumph as Thurley Precore
has demonstrated to us would be irreparable.”</p>

<p>No one mentioned the criticism to Thurley—there
was no need to do so. Two days after it was printed
and her manager told her she must go on a concert tour
in February, Thurley dressed herself deliberately in a
gown as gleamingly white and glitteringly silver as a path
of moonlight; it fairly clothed her in romance. She tied
green tulle about her hair and, taking a cloak of emerald
green velours, she drove to Bliss Hobart’s apartment,
having had Hortense first ’phone to ask if he would be at
home.</p>

<p>During the drive she planned what she should say with
the artifice of a world coquette. Thurley had fallen prey
to Lissa’s spell, yet she had, being denied the simple ties
of acknowledged relationships, found scant solace in the
bizarre theories of a small but powerful portion of the
world. She had told herself with the recklessness of
youth that she was different from others, therefore she
had the right to live in different fashion, to love in different
fashion if she chose ... she would not stay a convent
sort of celebrity with every one adoring and applauding
and copying her in every way imaginable yet no
one becoming happily related to her. She regarded Ernestine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
as a remote, though precious, older sister who had
made a bad error in becoming so aloof; she wanted Collin
to marry Polly Harris in the good old-fashioned way,
since Polly had no more chance of writing successful
opera than the fire escape of her attic of turning into a
marble stairway. She was undecided as to Caleb’s destiny.
Lissa was interesting, even with her jealousies and
vanities, her greed for all material things—Thurley
suddenly realized that Lissa was interesting because she
never corrected one, she never proved the wrong of this
or the right of that—and who, not excepting rosy youth,
does not incline to him who never reproves but merely
condones? Mark did not really interest Thurley, since
she had ceased trying to deny the truth to herself—that
she loved Bliss Hobart in such tense fashion that she
thought of him as her inspiration in whatsoever she did!
The only solace she had when Hobart busied himself
with new pupils, going here and there to decide this or
that question, or when society women flocked about to try
their best to fascinate, was that he treated the entire
world with the same indifference and kindly patronage
and, if Thurley still hoped through magical power to
waken in him romantic love, she had sense enough to keep
her secret well hidden—from herself most of the time—in
order that she might do her work and stay within his
jurisdiction.</p>

<p>She found Hobart and Caleb Patmore playing chess,
a favorite recreation of the former’s.</p>

<p>“I’m quite a gamester,” Caleb said, with visible relief
as she appeared. “Ernestine lapses into childhood
via dominoes and Collin actually stops painting to drag
me into casino—casino, Thurley! Why do you not
stroke my brow or show some symptom of humanity?
Polly Harris yearns for cribbage; you know Polly still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
hints of that ancestry of hers where she had school
marms for aunts and judges for uncles and her cousins all
went to military academies. Why this odd devil takes to
chess for his pleasure—I understand it not. Help, ho,
Thurley, take my place—will you?”</p>

<p>Thurley hesitated. It was not to her liking nor her
intention to have any one present at her visit, but she
dallied the question gracefully, submitting a list of songs
for the concert tour and pretending grave anxiety as to
the recovery of one of the songbirds recently in a motor
accident.</p>

<p>As she rose to go, inventing a dinner engagement, Hobart
accompanied her into the reception hall, leaving
Caleb straddled on the fire-settle wondering—who
knows what?</p>

<p>“What did you really want?” Hobart asked, as she
paused before the door. “Don’t tell me you’re going to
do Red Cross work and wear a uniform—”</p>

<p>“It’s the criticism,” she said simply. “It hurt—you
might have warned me when you saw my faults.”</p>

<p>“I warned you not to waste summers,” he reminded.
“I said all I could. You are no longer my pupil and I
have other things which take my time.”</p>

<p>“What shall I do?” she demanded petulantly. “I
will not be a mere shooting-star person as so many would
like to see me—”</p>

<p>“Well, well, let us see.” He placed his hands on her
shoulders in the benevolent, paternal fashion she so admired.
But she spoiled it by trying to flirt with him as
she looked up.</p>

<p>He dropped his hands as if he read the meaning of
the coquettish gaze. “Suppose you find a hobby, Thurley;
put all your airs and mannerisms into it. It often
works for the best good—what shall it be? Collecting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
butterflies or canes, opening Indian mounds—trying to
write a play—discovering the fourth dimension—eh?”</p>

<p>Tears were in her eyes. And the big ache of her
heart was changed into a sob which rose in her throat
with a penitent murmur.</p>

<p>“You are cruel,” she said in a fierce little rage.</p>

<p>“You funny, lovely, little fool!” he laughed, but in
soul-healing fashion. “Just be the old Thurley and we’ll
love you as we did at first!” After which he opened the
door and went down to her cab, telling her how becoming
was the costume she wore as <i>Elsa</i> and promising to send
her a book of golf anecdotes which he considered excellent.
She drove off feeling somewhat as Hortense
Quinby had expressed it—a mere onlooker at something
she craved but could never attain. She wanted to rout
Caleb from the fire-settle and sit there herself until Bliss
Hobart should return, to say to him with the assurance
with which loved wives are blessed,</p>

<p>“Darling, how stupid of any one to come in to-night—please
bolt the door and finish the story we started. I’ll
snuggle down on this cushion and lean against your knee.
I like to watch the fire as you read to see the characters
slip about the coals.... I’m very silly, Bliss, but there’s
no need for me to reform, God made you wise enough for
us both!” ...</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXV</h2>

<p>Spring brought again the longing for Birge’s Corners.
Nothing else appealed to Thurley in the way of a vacation.
Europe was barred from the engagement tablet,
cruising brought memories of Lissa’s yachting party and
society flirted in vain with Thurley to gain her appearance
at Allied benefits and bazaars. Beyond a compliance
to please her manager, she declined.</p>

<p>During the winter Miss Clergy had become more and
more insensible to everything save the fact that Thurley
Precore was a prima donna and she had achieved her
aim. Such matters as vacations were left in Thurley’s
hands.</p>

<p>Ernestine had decided her work was going stale, so a
California school where only a handful of the wise and
great assembled took her westward with scarcely time to
say good-by, Caleb complained.</p>

<p>Caleb devoted himself to emotional war charities since
they sold his books—particularly when he would stand
in the Belgian booth decorated with streamers like a true
harlequin and, fountain pen in hand, await the onslaught
of damsels demanding he would autograph their copies of
his novels.</p>

<p>Lissa also gave up her time to following the wake of
these functions, since she looked well in lace gowns and
the supposed patriotic charity on her part bore rich returns
in the way of pupils. Watching Lissa, Thurley
became aware of another truth: to be an intriguer in art
or any other capacity requires that one be not a fool but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
possessed of shrewd talents and determination. It takes
much time and foresight to be successful in this bent, but
if one follows this doubtful path to achieving distinction
one has little time left with which to pursue the ethical
path of sincere work which wins its own reward.</p>

<p>Besides being an intriguer, Lissa reflected Mark’s
fame. She never lost an opportunity with which to have
their names associated, to call herself a “romantic old
sister to the dear lad,” or appear at his recitals to sing
some lightweight thing with the high, phenomenal note
which alone won applause.</p>

<p>“It seems to me,” Collin said to Thurley one June
afternoon when they were enduring a recital of Lissa’s
songs at a lawn fête, “that God started in to give Lissa
a wonderful voice. He began with this tiptop note and
then, as He realized what she was bound to be in spite
of every one concerned, He did not bestow anything else
on her, but she must have slipped down to earth pirating
that note for surely it was meant to be taken away from
her!”</p>

<p>Thurley nodded her gratitude for his expression and
Polly, who was sitting on Collin’s other side, gave vent to
an impudent giggle.</p>

<p>“Thurley, did you know people say that ‘Miss Precore
is a recluse’?” Polly asked her a moment later.
“That she refuses to sing for charity?”</p>

<p>“Of course Miss Precore has not worked all winter,
oh, no,” Thurley’s temper flared up. “Polly and Collin,
I tell you both that I am tired even to my professional
expression. Look at Lissa—look at Mark—look
here,” she began, pointing out other salubrities and celebrities
who were murmuring or warbling “poor bleeding
Europe” in properly guttural tones.</p>

<p>Polly was thoughtful and when Collin roused her to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
explain why, she said, “Suppose we go to war, Thurley,
what then?”</p>

<p>“We’ll do what is needed,” Thurley said in as sharp
fashion as Hobart could have replied.</p>

<p>Hortense Quinby came searching the audience to deliver
a telegram to Thurley, delighted with her opportunity
to appear important.</p>

<p>It was a good-by note from Hobart and of no importance,
so Thurley thought as she read it:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent"><i>Dear Thurley</i>—</p>

<p>Leaving for my vacation to-night and sorry not to say
good-by, will send up the new operas I told you about—don’t
waste this summer</p>

<p class="right">B. H.</p>

</div>

<p>She rose and excused herself from the entertainment,
which caused half the audience to say that “Thurley
Precore liked to create scenes” and the other half “she
was a purse-proud young woman with no patriotism.”</p>

<p>Polly and Collin stayed the performance out, since two
of the women Collin had painted were taking part in the
tableaux and had sent him those telling three-cornered
notes on mauve linen requesting that he see them as
“France Enraged” and “Belgium at Bay.”</p>

<p>Polly stayed because Collin stayed. After the next
number was well under way, Collin, stroking that mad,
blond beard of his, asked,</p>

<p>“What’s wrong with Thurley? She’s not been herself
all winter and she is going off in her voice.”</p>

<p>“Who wouldn’t—living with a ghost person and
working harder than an engineer? Bliss will find her a
coach this fall who will treat her mercilessly and make
her grind again. It isn’t that any singing teacher can
teach Thurley things; they merely shut her up in figurative<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
fashion in a dark closet until she promises to behave and
sing the way in which she knows she should.”</p>

<p>“She went it rapidly for a time,” Collin reflected,
languidly applauding the antics of a folk dance done by
“lanky hanks of shes”—“do look behind to see if Hortense
Quinby is listening. I’ve an idea she sells her
eavesdropping per word to Caleb ... ever notice how
she plays ferret when two or three are gathered together
talking in an undertone?”</p>

<p>“She’s in pursuit of the professor of ethnology that
Mrs. Barnhardt has in tow; he’s a widower on the loose,”
Polly chuckled.</p>

<p>“All power to her—what’s on for your summer?”</p>

<p>“Work, I presume.” Polly’s face lost its gaiety.
Drudging through a winter of failure with Bliss Hobart
telling her she was naught but wilful in refusing to accept
the inevitable and also a position—salt in the wound—of
assistant librarian for the opera house—it was sufficient
to bring about the change of expression. “What
is ahead for you?”</p>

<p>“No work, I refuse all commissions, the Allied generals
might beg in vain. I’m going to play; there’s a lot
of us who are going to visit Bliss at his hermitage.”</p>

<p>“What luck! Really invade his sacred portals?”</p>

<p>“Well, we call it play. I’m to go and the Russian
who writes and that funny little man with the square
head, Tyronne—he does those historical essays no one
reads but every one looks at underneath a glass case in
a hundred years or so. And Caleb and Bliss had a row
about Caleb’s not writing as he should and Caleb isn’t
coming. Poor old Sam is in Lunnon recruiting and he is
out, too. But we are going to try to loaf away the summer.
I’ll put a sign on my gate, Shoo flies, don’t bother
me, I’ve gone off to the north countree—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span></p>

<p>He was selfishly unconscious of Polly’s expression.</p>

<p>“How splendid!” was all she said. “I wish I were
a boy. I’d go along as Oolong Formosa, the only valet
who did not anger the master by gaining a university
diploma just when I had become proficient in whisk
brooming!”</p>

<p>Collin laughed. “You’re a weird little thought,” he
said carelessly. “Sometimes I think you’ll never grow
old. We’ll be tottering graybeards and Ernestine and
Thurley wrinkled dowagers, but you will still be Polly,
brown-faced and boyish! Now, I say, why not give up
your big dream for a bit, leave it for the next lifetime and
will yourself to be born a long-haired Polish genius with
opera scores fairly dripping off your brow—come on,
Polly, be my secretary. I need one. Look at the young
women who do Caleb’s stuff and Ernestine has that depressing,
rubber tired young woman with a bumpy forehead
and Thurley the Quinby monstrosity. I’m terribly
behind. Please, help a chap out. It’s proper for you
to be my secretary since no one can accuse us of being in
love—I’ll leave you carte blanche and the key to Parva
Sed Apta; you can tidy me up like a good elf, answer
notes and even wash my paint brushes.” There was
something gentle and generous in Collin’s joyous eyes as
he watched her struggle <em>not</em> to accept.</p>

<p>“I’d be slacking from what I’ve set out to do,” she
said finally. “This war may rob us of our future composers
abroad and it’s my time to take their place. I
study every night, Collin, no matter how I’ve been working
and I’ve made plans for the summer.”</p>

<p>“Study at Parva Sed Apta!”</p>

<p>She shook her head. “I’d rather not. Maybe I’ll
have to come to it some time, be an out and out dependent,
perhaps—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span></p>

<p>Collin put his hand down to cover her small, brownish
ones. “Why, Polly, you mustn’t go getting morbid.
It’s that damned fire escape and attic of yours and the
hungry wolves howling outside your door every time
you’ve a crumb to spare. Come along into the sunshine—and
filled pantry shelves. Play I’m big brother to a
little bohemian.”</p>

<p>They were standing for the “Star-Spangled Banner,”
and Polly, glad of the release, sprang to her feet and
lustily sang the words. But she persisted in her refusal
and Collin, a little displeased, told Caleb before he left
town to keep a weather eye on Polly and, if she started
absurd things like fainting, to kidnap her and take her
to Parva Sed Apta where she could protest in helpless
but very comfortable surroundings!</p>

<p>Collin did not in the least understand, despite his ability
to read his subjects in banal, neutral fashion and to see
the inner meanings. He was blind to Polly’s tragedy,
one of the most cruel of tragedies in the world—unreturned
yet undying love.</p>

<p>In fact Collin was becoming used to his subjects’ asking
that special skill be used in the painting of the lace wedding
veil or accurate copying of the gold braided uniform
of an army officer—so that popular marionettes were
the result, when all the time it was with difficulty that his
joyous eyes did not see far beneath the lace veil or the
uniform and paint the obscure truths be they ugly or
beautiful!</p>

<p class="tb">Calling on Thurley a week after the garden fête to
urge her appearance at a Newport carnival, Caleb was
amazed to find her apartment shrouded in gray linen and
even the mirrors tied with gauze. Hortense, in the
pleasant rôle of a stay-behind martyr, received him to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
tell the news. Thurley had returned to Birge’s Corners—the
Fincherie was the name of Miss Clergy’s house—to
spend the summer!</p>

<p>“All at once she demanded the old environment, a
strange homesickness engulfed her,” Hortense began
analytically, delighted to have Caleb at her mercy. “I
cannot say whether or not it is wise—but home she has
gone. Although she left plenty to do,” she could not
refrain from adding, “but, even so, it will be lonesome
for me.”</p>

<p>At which Caleb fled, threatening punishment to Thurley
for having run him into danger. Later, he received
a note stating that Thurley was at the Fincherie and she
would have a house party in August, to save the time out
for that because she was sure he would find plenty of new
types.</p>

<p>“I’ll be hanged,” Caleb ruminated over the situation
before he wrote Ernestine the news. “But didn’t Thurley
leave a boy-sweetheart in Birge’s Corners?”</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVI</h2>

<p>The reopening of the Fincherie with magical haste,
untold extravagance and new notions set the town gossiping
anew.</p>

<p>To see every window wide open and Betsey and Hopeful
polishing them while Ali Baba hurried to and fro on
all sorts of errands bent, to know that the stable was
empty of its coupé and motor cars were installed, while
a pert maid with a cap with streamers minced down the
streets and smiled superciliously at every one—it was
enough to give the Corners palpitation of the heart.</p>

<p>The general verdict was that Thurley had returned
“to lord it over every one.” A few more romantically
inclined thought she had come back to “win Dan from
’Raine.” One or two simple souls believed she might be
genuinely anxious to be at home again, at least the only
home she had ever known.</p>

<p>Thurley bothered little with public opinion. With
false assurance as to her ideas, she proceeded to put them
into practice without delay. The devil always favoring
a new recruit, it would seem, she met with considerable
success.</p>

<p>To still the wondering as to Bliss’s summers, the loneliness
for a personal relationship and the fag in her head
brought about by a season’s hard work and the war agitation,
Thurley played along in Lissa’s own manner.</p>

<p>She treated the Corners with good-natured disdain.
There was a trifle of the boaster in her as she wore her
new creations and drove her smart cab about, smoked
openly and permitted unwrapped cases of champagne to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
be sent up from the station. But the boasting was because
of two elements, the child’s love of mischief and the
woman’s loneliness and determination to let no one suspect
that she had repented of her strange bargain.</p>

<p>She had driven into the town with Miss Clergy beside
her, quite content as long as Thurley was satisfied, Thurley
in a startling gown of mulberry chiffon and a jet toque
and her driver in a trig green uniform to match the body
of the limousine.</p>

<p>The word spread like fire, “Thurley Precore is back,
grand as a princess, famous as all outdoors—paint on
her cheeks—Miss Clergy is human—it <em>is</em> so, all they’ve
said about ’em—watch Dan Birge, sore’n a hedgehog,
watch ’Raine—there’ll be doings if she stays.”</p>

<p>There was no attempt at actually refurnishing the Fincherie,
but only to let sun stream in and soap and water
do its best. A piano was the only added asset save the
motor cars, the lady’s maid and Thurley’s accompanist.
Thurley preferred to have the contrast of old style furniture,
and Miss Clergy wandered vaguely like a lost
child through the rooms, smiling with delight at the memories
such and such a table or chair recalled; she even
pointed to where she had danced the businesslike little
polka at her coming out party.</p>

<p>But when Thurley came face to face with Betsey,
Hopeful or Ali Baba, all trace of the sophisticated young
woman vanished and she flew into their arms in such natural
fashion that they afterwards said in stout defense of
her, “Thurley ain’t changed a mite—unless people act
changed to her!”</p>

<p>Nevertheless there was a change. No one can go
away from a village as a runaway beggar girl taking the
town mystery and richest person in it at the same time
and leave a broken heart to keep green her memory,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
without somewhat of a readjustment. Nor can she return
three years later both famous and rich and lovelier
than ever without further complications.</p>

<p>The homey things which Thurley had anticipated
would set her right in magic fashion irritated and disappointed
her. She wanted to return the same wild rose
she had left, being treated as such. But her grandeur
was like a stone wall over which the village took turns at
peeking and saying, “Well, well, well, so this is Thurley
Precore—well, well, <em>well</em>!”</p>

<p>Twelve hours after she had come into the town she was
bored to extinction. She missed the excitement of her
other life and wondered why she had not stayed on to do
the things society had begged of her. Birge’s Corners
was as removed from the real world as Iceland from the
tropics, they did not appreciate or comprehend her! She
was still just a “lucky girl” in their eyes; they almost
questioned her success. She would have to die and leave
funds for a public drinking fountain before the village
would acclaim her as their own with joy and alacrity.</p>

<p>The hills seemed small and stunted and the air over-dusty
and hot. The old drive along the river was stupid,
she decided, as she took it and was prepared to be drifted
back into enchanted girlhood. Her accompanist, who
was with her, agreed when Thurley remarked that one
never remembered childhood joys with accuracy. The
accompanist was thinking of <em>her</em> own home town where
the hills were green and gorgeous and the river sparkling—but
the accompanist had not been home in some time
either!</p>

<p>The summer yawned before Thurley like a dark cavern.
She longed for fall and work—glimpses of Hobart
with snubs and sarcasm from him if nothing else.
She wanted Ernestine; she felt she could become as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
cynical as Ernestine with no trouble at all and she would
agree with Caleb that “kiss-baby” copy was perfectly
proper if people were fools enough to pay for it; she resolved
to play cards for money the next winter, as Lissa
urged, and really to bully Polly into accepting decent
clothes and being some one respectable. She wanted
Collin to paint her portrait in a certain cream satin frock,
because she wanted to know what Hobart would say of
it, and as for Mark—there was a dangerous expression
in Thurley’s eyes as she thought of what she might or
might not do concerning him ... besides, there were
many others who would pay her attention, rich, powerful,
foolish creatures who follow such butterflies as religiously
as the hounds do the hares. Every one must decide early
in the game if he is to run with the hounds or with
the hares! Thurley had not yet decided. She knew
that as she came home from the disappointing river drive
the last resolve to be natural and her wild-rose self vanished—it
was the final straw which turned her in the
way Lissa’s white fingers had pointed.</p>

<p>Vows or no vows, Thurley would live! And if she
loved some one who chose to live a hermit’s life—— And
did he live a hermit’s life despite this chatter of a Maine
hermitage? There was room for reasonable doubt.
Thurley would live as she pleased, time enough to take
the consequences!</p>

<p>She began cheering the accompanist by promises of a
house party and her own drooping spirits by the promise
of thoroughly shocking the narrow, well-meaning town.</p>

<p>When they drove into the stableyard and Ali Baba
came out as was his custom, Thurley sent the accompanist
into the house and wandered back with Ali Baba.</p>

<p>“Seems mighty fine to have you back,” he said.</p>

<p>“Good to be back, Ali Baba. Well, have I changed so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
much?” she asked, waiting curiously for the old man’s
opinion.</p>

<p>He shook his head. “If your mother was to have
kissed you good-by, I’m gosh hanged whether or not she’d
know you now! You’re a great lady.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense, it’s just the clothes. Let’s talk about
every one else but me. I want to get Hopeful and Betsey
fur coats next winter and you’ll have to find out the
sort they like.”</p>

<p>“I guess singin’ pays,” he ventured.</p>

<p>Thurley had led the way inside the barn and settled
herself on a bench. “How is June Myers and Josie
Donaldson—see, I haven’t forgotten their names—and—Lorraine—and
Dan?” she tried to say easily.</p>

<p>Ali Baba glanced at her shrewdly. “Oh, June is the
same little whiffet she always was and Josie is tryin’ to
write a play; she’ll come to see you, don’t never worry....
We got a new kind of fool here—Owen Pringle;
he has an art store and when he heard you was comin’,
he sent to town for photographs of you—I didn’t know
you could buy ’em right out—and he wants you to autograph
’em and then he’ll sell ’em—don’t you write a
stroke of the pen—and his clerk, Cora Spooner—oh,
we got a right good stock of pests on hand. I tell you,
Thurley, things ain’t like they used to be.”</p>

<p>“You didn’t say about—Dan,” Thurley urged, wondering
why she trembled.</p>

<p>“Fine—business growing. Was you scared the first
time you come out on the stage?”</p>

<p>“Not much. How are all the home folks, that’s what
I want to know.”</p>

<p>Ali Baba lit his pipe in democratic fashion. “All up
to snuff, fools included ... goin’ to sing in meetin’?”</p>

<p>“If I’m asked.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, for land’s sake and Mrs. Davis,” he commanded,
“sing somethin’ with a regular tune. I can’t
go these songs that slide all over and back again afore a
feller gets his foot to tappin’ on time.... Guess you
learned to sing in Eyetalian from what you write Betsey?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>He snorted disapproval. To his mind, as to the majority
of village minds, there was no more object in discarding
one’s coherent language to speak another than to
shave off one’s hair and adopt a wig.</p>

<p>“How is Lorraine?” Thurley studied the barn floor.</p>

<p>“Too good to be true.” Ali Baba stood up and
started to examine an old strap. “Her pa is prouder
of her every minnit ... she’s made Dan a fine wife—had
me up for supper and treated me as fine as silk....
Dan’s a great lad.” He became engrossed in opening
the buckle.</p>

<p>Thurley slipped away. Later, Ali Baba told Betsey,</p>

<p>“Opery singers or no opery singers, women is all
alike. If they give a fellow the mitten, they just can’t
help comin’ back to see how he’s wearin’ it!”</p>

<p>Dan was in South Wales the day Thurley arrived.
When he returned to the Corners a week later, the town
was chattering with new gusto, but he learned the news
from Lorraine herself,—from Lorraine, who had been
trying to gain courage enough to call on Thurley and blot
out memories of that hidden magazine and the unproved
yet strong impression that Dan had not confined himself
to magazine pictures of Thurley. Just wherein
lay his infidelity she did not know; she shrank as do
women of her makeup from ever discovering!</p>

<p>Dan came in buoyantly to waltz her around as was his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
custom, telling of his success with this man and that and
plans for the branch store.</p>

<p>“What’s wrong?” he asked, realizing that she was not
dimpling with happiness and nodding approbation at
every sentence he spoke.</p>

<p>Lorraine disengaged herself from his arm and stood
back, twisting her apron nervously. “The town has
something new to talk about, Dan. Who do you think
is back for the summer?” laughing nervously.</p>

<p>“I don’t know. Who ever comes back here?”</p>

<p>“Miss Clergy—and Thurley.” It was a relief now
her name was spoken. “They’ve reopened the Fincherie,
and Thurley has a maid and chauffeur and about
eight trunks—so Ali Baba says.”</p>

<p>Dan whistled softly. “What do you think of that?”
was his sole comment.</p>

<p>“I suppose I ought to call on her,” Lorraine continued
bravely, “although she may not care to know any
one of us now. She’s so famous and changed! Ali Baba
says she smokes and paints her face and the lady’s maid
is prettier than any one in the village. She had her piano
shipped from New York and an accompanist besides!
Do you think I ought to call?” Lorraine’s little face
was wrinkled anxiously.</p>

<p>“If you like—I don’t suppose Thurley <em>does</em> care,”
Dan went over to the lounge and, flinging himself down,
picked up a newspaper, “or she would never have left
here! Anything else new—nobody lynched Owen yet—Cora
got a new beau? I saw a travelling man in
Hamilton that was her speed. When he comes here
we’ll ask him over and let Cora do her best. I suppose
Hazel and Josie have camped out here while I’ve been
away. You look pale, ’Raine—what’s wrong—your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
dad sick? Then come here and guess what I brought
for you—”</p>

<p>“You’re always bringing me things,” she said wistfully.
Even his reassuring words did not satisfy. They
were spoken with a glib uneasiness which did not deceive.</p>

<p>“You extravagant Dan,” Lorraine said, examining the
silver purse, “how lovely of you!”</p>

<p>“I’m going to take forty winks before supper—mind?
I can’t get used to irregular hours and country
hotels. Oh, ’Raine, small towns are the devil’s own
makings, of all the narrow, carping—” Dan dozed off,
apparently, with unfinished sentiments giving way to regular
breathing.</p>

<p>Lorraine tiptoed away. “He didn’t seem to mind,”
she consoled herself as she cooked supper, “but he has
not seen her!”</p>

<p>Lorraine had. She watched Thurley as she drove by,
standing half hidden behind bushes to note every lovely,
strange detail of her appearance, wondering why Thurley,
who had brought the world to her feet so easily, must
return to this village to steal the peace of mind of a
woman who had not even brought the one man she loved
to her own timid feet!</p>

<p>Dan stayed at home that evening as if wishing to prove
his devotion to Lorraine. Usually he would have wandered
down to the hotel or the lodge room. They
talked of everything else but Thurley’s return, although
each thought of nothing else, and in the morning Dan
said carelessly,</p>

<p>“Don’t call on Thurley unless you like. I dare say
she does not expect it. Every gawk of a country girl will
crowd in on her, curious and self-seeking, and if Thurley
wants to see any one, she’ll come to them. She doesn’t
belong to the town any more but to the world.” His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
voice softened as he added, “Good-by, dear; now don’t
work your head off. I’ll lunch at the hotel—there is so
much stuff to catch up on.”</p>

<p>That same afternoon Dan’s car drove slowly past the
Fincherie, whose crisp curtains and lifted shades told the
world a new, optimistic story. No one was visible, not
even the much discussed lady’s maid or the accompanist
who was said to sit on the lawn and drink endless cups of
tea “right in the middle of the afternoon!”</p>

<p>Further along in the road he was hailed by a dreaded
trio—Josie, Hazel and Cora!</p>

<p>“Oh, Dan, do take us by her house,” they began,
waving their arms in wild invitation. “We’re crazy to
see her—Cora never knew her,” Josie Donaldson explained
by way of excuse as they climbed pell mell into the
machine.</p>

<p>“I guess she won’t want to remember us,” Josie added,
“but ma sent over my winter coat one time and she wore
it two seasons—she ought to know <em>me</em>.”</p>

<p>“My aunt helped her a lot too,” added Hazel Mitchell,
“and she borrowed every one’s books. I don’t think
she’ll dare put on airs. I’m going to start right in and
call her Thurley just as if I didn’t know she was famous.
I’m dying to get inside that house. Just think, girls, it
hasn’t been opened for years until—” Thin ice was fast
approaching in the matter of the past and with a swift
side glance at Dan, who steered ahead with a fiendish
hope of dashing his human cargo off the nearest cliff,
Hazel winked at the others and began anew,</p>

<p>“How’s Lorraine?”</p>

<p>“Fine! Where do you girls want to go?”</p>

<p>“To call on Thurley. Please, Dan, drive us up there.
It’ll look so much better if we came in a machine.”</p>

<p>“Your machine, anyhow,” giggled Josie.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span></p>

<p>“Aren’t you working to-day?” he asked Hazel savagely.</p>

<p>“I had a headache and the doctor said I needed fresh
air.”</p>

<p>“Then you better stay outdoors instead of calling on
people, if it’s fresh air you are after,” he advised.</p>

<p>Nothing but giggles answered him and they hailed the
white clad figure of Owen Pringle, who held up his cane
in threatening fashion.</p>

<p>“You sha’n’t have the prettiest girls all to yourself,
you old married man,” he threatened. “Do let me sit
in the back—”</p>

<p>Unwillingly, Dan halted the car and a new element of
disturbance was added.</p>

<p>“We want to call on Thurley Precore,” they told
Owen, who was always at his best when his arms were
full of girl and some one else was driving the car.
“Come along and we’ll ask her to let you design some
hats—come on.”</p>

<p>“Joyful, joyful, joyful,” he began in an assumed falsetto,
at which Dan drew the car to a standstill and
looked around with a frown.</p>

<p>“I don’t wish to call on Thurley,” he said sharply,
“as you well know. If you insist on my driving you up
to her house, I’ll do so. My wife will call on her when
she sees fit.”</p>

<p>Which somewhat subdued the quartette, who murmured
their gratitude and were hurriedly raced back until
the Fincherie was reached. Whispering their thanks,
each personally thinking what a dreadful disposition Dan
Birge had, they raced up the walk—the leisure class of
Birge’s Corners, as Dan thought with half a chuckle.</p>

<p>He was wondering what Thurley would say to them,
as he turned his machine in the opposite direction.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVII</h2>

<p>Dan’s car rounded the driveway of the cemetery, one of
those desolate country burial grounds on a remote hill
with a neglected wooden fence running about it and wild
shrubbery crowding in on the graves. He saw a smart
cab in front of the tottering gate. He knew it belonged
to but one person—Thurley—and he deliberately
halted his machine and crossed the road to read the telling
monogram T. P. entwined with fantastic plumes, consolation
for having no real ancestors or crest. As he did
so, Dan was glad—glad with all his heart!</p>

<p>He climbed the path which was nearest Philena’s
grave. He knew Thurley would be beside it.</p>

<p>... She was sitting with her back towards him, lost
in her thoughts and unconscious of any one’s being close
at hand.</p>

<p>Dan paused. He was trembling—as Lorraine trembled
when he had so grudgingly asked her hand in marriage.
He knew Thurley had never loved him in the
deepest sense—and yet—he seemed to see her as the
old wild-rose girl in gingham, waiting for her lover’s
coming!</p>

<p>He put his hand to his head as if it pained. Then he
came a step in advance. It was hard work to believe this
was Thurley. She wore a wonderful silk driving coat
which covered an afternoon frock of val lace tied with
pink ribbons and a petticoat of pink satin. Her hat, a
large, white lace affair, lay beside her, its silver ties half
hidden in the grass. Her brown hair was smooth and
glossy, betraying endless brushing and care. One hand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
halfway supported her splendid, tall self—it was very
white these days and the nails shone, while a ring
of diamonds sparkled up in triumph. Her pink satin
slipper toes and the flesh-colored stockings peeked out
coquettishly. With a flash of humor Dan spied the tiny
anklet watch on its braided, glittering chain. Thurley
was very close to the crimson rambler plant which she
and Dan planted for Philena on a Memorial Day, long
before Thurley had said her reluctant yes!</p>

<p>Here he stepped on a twig whose crackling noise caused
Thurley to turn half way and glance up with neither fear
nor surprise—nor special delight.</p>

<p>“Why, it’s Dan Birge,” was all she said, raising her
hand cordially.</p>

<p>“Do you mind?” His voice sounded weak and far
away. “May I sit down? I—I was passing and I saw
your cab; I was sure it was yours from the monogram—”</p>

<p>“If you like. How nice to see you again!” She
spoke in such deliberate fashion that Dan wondered
whether she was pretending. She seemed years older.
It was not the rouge nor the sophisticated look in the
blue eyes—nothing one could describe, unless one wished
to be abstruse and say her soul had aged.</p>

<p>Dan broke the pause by saying lightly, “Odd we should
meet here, isn’t it? I was out of town when you came—Lorraine
told me about it last night. She asked if she
should call—I didn’t know whether or not you’d like to
have her.”</p>

<p>“It would be most kind,” Thurley said in the same
even voice. “I have been deluged with calls—mostly
out of curiosity. Or to see if I would deny having worn
some one else’s clothes and having lived in a box-car ...
the old car was used for kindling for a poor family, Ali
Baba says.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span></p>

<p>“I didn’t know about it until it was too late to save it.
It hurt when I thought of your old wagon being chopped
up.”</p>

<p>“Did it? Sentimental goose,” she managed to laugh
at him.</p>

<p>“Were you having a serious ‘think’?” he asked,
after a brief silence.</p>

<p>“About Philena—” She plucked some long blades
of grass and began plaiting them into a ring. “How
well you look! Lorraine takes good care of you, doesn’t
she? Does she look as splendidly?”</p>

<p>“Wish she did—you’ll see her, no doubt.”</p>

<p>“If I stay here. I threatened to move this morning.
Some old neighbors came in during my practice hour—they
don’t understand!”</p>

<p>“What made you come back,” he asked with a flash of
the old boy spirit, “when you never even wrote me!”</p>

<p>“Do you think it was yourself?”</p>

<p>“No. I’m quite removed from you in every way.
Why, that dress and ring cost more than Lorraine spends
in a year! As Ali Baba says, ‘you are a great lady’—for
you wouldn’t have come back unless you were,” he
added honestly. “It makes us feel shabby and underdone
by contrast.... Of course I never hope to be the
same to you—you have everything the world can give
you for pleasure and attention. I’m not deluding myself.
I’m not such a jay as most of the boys—”</p>

<p>“You never were,” she supplemented quickly.</p>

<p>“I always tried to be ‘citified,’ to wake the town up
and keep abreast of the times. Anyway, I loved the
finest girl the village ever knew.” There was a quiver in
his voice. It was like reopening a newly healed wound
and letting it bleed a trifle.</p>

<p>“And you married her,” Thurley insisted, the coquette<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
coming to the surface. She tilted her head to look down
at him through half closed, purplish eyes.</p>

<p>“I <em>loved</em> her—and I have a splendid wife,” Dan corrected.</p>

<p>“What a lot happens in three years!” Thurley finished
the grass ring and stuck it on her engagement finger.
“Shall I make one for you?”</p>

<p>“Do! Ought I to be here taking up your time?
Perhaps you wanted to get away from every one or you
wouldn’t have come.” Dan felt the contrast between
them more and more; his clothes seemed poorly fitted
and his scarf pin a trifle gaudy, his shoes the fire-sale variety—a
country bumpkin beside this adorable, tall girl
in the lace and pink satin with distracting, tangly ribbons.</p>

<p>“I like to talk to you, Dan. I wondered how we
would meet!”</p>

<p>“What made you come back?” he demanded. “It
wasn’t the Corners and I don’t flatter myself it was me
... for you could have written me at any time and I
would have come!”</p>

<p>The slim fingers stopped plaiting the grass. “Would
you—<em>really</em>?”</p>

<p>He looked at her with despairing eyes. “Did you
get any big baskets of orchids and lilies with a card,
‘from an old friend’?”</p>

<p>“Were they from you?” she said sadly. “Oh, Dan,
it was too bad you ever had to care for me!”</p>

<p>“Can you stop the birds from singing or the sun from
shining—or a fool for loving some one very fine?”</p>

<p>“Why, no,” Thurley looked out at the hills. “That’s
always the hardest thing in the world—not the caring
for some one but caring for some one who doesn’t care
for you!”</p>

<p>Dan reached over to take her hand. “Is it that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
that brought you here?” he asked tenderly. “Doesn’t
some one love you? You needn’t answer. I know ...
so fame isn’t enough,” he dropped her hand almost
roughly. “Everything’s in the devil of a mess,” he
remarked to no one in particular.</p>

<p>Thurley caught the drift of his remark. “It’s the
devil of a mess,” she repeated clearly, “because we are
not bad enough to be all bad and do terrible things that
blot out the hurts or not all good so we can be saints with
wings and harps for consolation ... we just struggle—most
of us.”</p>

<p>“When did you know I was married?”</p>

<p>“The night of my début—like a story, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“And we were there—’Raine and I—on our wedding
trip.” After three years’ attempt at bravado, the
real heart of him was allowed to suffer, suffer as it should
have done three years ago instead of fanning revengeful
temper on as a worthless substitute.</p>

<p>Thurley faced him directly, hugging her long legs under
her boy fashion. “I’m not worth it. The best part
of me is my voice, Dan. Only the worst part of me
isn’t content to have it that way. I’ve worked mighty
hard since we said good-by—I’ve known all sorts and
conditions of people, great and near great, good and
bad—I’ve had all sorts of men make love to me and
I’ve encouraged all sorts of men—just so far. I’ve
done things no one would approve of my doing and
some things that only a few could approve of or understand.
Mostly though I’ve worked and worked and
I’ve decided that it is either work for me all my days
if I’m to keep on singing, or else I’ll stop working and
love and be loved, perhaps. But the two do not go hand
in hand ... perhaps I’m bitter.”</p>

<p>“She made you promise never to marry,” Dan interrupted;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
“she is a selfish old woman who wasn’t
fair!”</p>

<p>Thurley nodded. “Love made her insane,” she defended.</p>

<p>After a moment Dan said, “Sing for me, Thurley, like
you used to—when things were different.”</p>

<p>Reaching out her hand, Thurley held his in simple
palship as she sang in a hushed voice the old tunes they
both had loved. As she finished, he said with an effort,</p>

<p>“Maybe we better not see each other this summer.”</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“Because I’m only a small town man with a mighty
fine wife and you are a genius coming here to amuse yourself,
to make yourself forget some one who doesn’t love
you—and that’s not a wise combination! I’m liable to
lose my head ... I kept it pretty well after you left.”</p>

<p>“Do you blame me?” She seemed contrite herself.
“Were you fair?”</p>

<p>“I suppose not. It was just the choice of two futures—you
chose the one intended for you. Only now that
you’ve chosen, don’t keep on bruising yourself and every
one else by trying to—trying to—”</p>

<p>“Don’t you want to see me?” She was determined
to have some one want to see her own self, whether or
not she sang a single note.</p>

<p>“Don’t I want to? I’ll always want to.” He came
closer to her. “Were you never sorry you went away?
It would help a lot to know.”</p>

<p>Closing her eyes and remembering as little of the three
years as was possible, nothing of her vow or Lorraine,
Thurley gave vent to her starved womanhood. “A
little,” she whispered.</p>

<p>“Then I will see you and be your pal,” was his answer.
“Let me be just that. No one can say there’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
any harm in it—not even ’Raine. I’ll have her call
on you, Thurley; that will make it right.” He was very
close now, his cheek almost touched her own. She drew
away.</p>

<p>“In opera those tenors make love as if you were their
own,” he said savagely. “I hated to see it!”</p>

<p>“But you were on your wedding journey,” she reminded.</p>

<p>They both laughed, jangling, noncontagious sounds.</p>

<p>“But, Dan, we’d never have gotten along,” she reminded
him. “I’m a creature of whims and moods—spoiled,
of course, it was inevitable.” She began telling
some of her experiences.</p>

<p>“But you won’t forbid my being just pal,” he urged,
as she consulted the anklet watch and found it tea-time.</p>

<p>“Not if you’re content to have it that way,” she promised.
“Run along and I’ll follow, it would never do to
have us drive off in unison.”</p>

<p>As she stood up her rumpled lace draperies made her
seem more like a little girl.</p>

<p>“Thurley, Thurley,” he said in sort of impassioned
reverie, “you have come back to me—”</p>

<p>“Only for the summer,” she answered in gay decision.
“Oh, Dan, remember I haven’t really found myself, nor
shall I, perhaps. So think of me as lightly as you can.
My present state of mind would permit of but one motto
for over my fireplace,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">‘Forty miles from wood,</div>
<div class="verse">Forty miles from water,</div>
<div class="verse">Forty miles from hell—</div>
<div class="verse">God bless our home!’”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Lorraine knew Dan had visited with Thurley, so did
the village. She wisely kept her counsel and consented to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
Dan’s stammering request that she call on Thurley—“after
all, it might look queer if she did not.”</p>

<p>So she went, as much of a martyr as she had been when
she brought Thurley the blue set for an engagement
present. This time she passed into the parlors of the
old-fashioned house aglow with their pretty trifles and
cut flowers, the grand piano in the center like a precocious
and not to be ignored child, and met Thurley in timid,
dignified manner, taking count of her Parisian costume,
her new mannerisms and accent, her rather flippant opinions
of the topics of the day, promising her thumping
little heart that when she was alone, in the peace of her
own house, she would struggle to regain her poise and
contentment of mind which this astonishingly charming
yet affected person fairly wrested from her!</p>

<p>In fact Birge’s Corners called on Thurley prepared to
ask curious and mortifying questions, only to make a
hurried exit in quite a different frame of mind. For
with a perfectly cordial manner Thurley met all alike.
She had a faculty of making them feel their own selves
quite impossible; they were ill at ease before her—nor
did they ask her to sing, she forestalled that before the
subject of the weather was exhausted. They left saying
that “Thurley had a way with her—and Dan could
thank his lucky star he had been saved from the marriage.”
Thurley repaid no calls—not even to Lorraine,
although the latter had asked her from a sense
of duty. She lived in her own way at the Fincherie
with Miss Clergy nodding approval on whatsoever she
did or demanded. In a short time, when she flooded the
town with what the village dubbed as lunatics, no one
was over-keen to have her call.</p>

<p>The “lunatics” were men with bangs, wearing broad
scarlet sashes and going without hats in the sun, sketching<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
under white umbrellas and talking “some queer language”;
the women had bobbed their hair and possessed
more gowns than brains; they slept away half the morning
and danced away half the night while Thurley was the
gayest of all the strange company, turning the Fincherie
lawn into a stage to have tableaux and folk dances, and
all her guests, bobbed-haired or banged or what not,
scowled at the natives curiously and commented upon
them audibly as if they were insensible of understanding.</p>

<p>Dan Birge was seen driving with Thurley, drinking
tea on the Fincherie lawn, being a spectator at the entertainments.
Lorraine grew more fragile-looking but
kept her own counsel and Owen Pringle failed to secure
an autograph or an order for a bonnet, while Josie, Cora
and Hazel found no encouragement or interest shown in
their dramatic, musical or matrimonial futures!</p>

<p>Presently, the Corners said it would be a blessing if
Thurley Precore would choose some other place to spend
her summers. Whatever made her pa and ma drive into
the town in the first place? She would get her “comeupment”
for this smartness, to say nothing of a real white
slave dance which she gave, at which she was auctioned
off to a big fat man with white hair and a tucked, crêpe
de chine shirt, who made his living playing on a little
penny whistle! The devil did not have all the good times
in the world—neither would Thurley Precore. The
older generation had felt from the first it was not boding
good luck to have so great a spirit develop suddenly via a
partly demented recluse. Here was proof enough!
For Thurley and her friends neither went to church nor
patronized church social affairs. They lived “like they
tell of,” was the report, “just as like to get up at three
o’clock in the morning to go on hollerin’ and yellin’ like
to wake the dead or else sleep like logs until noon ...<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
and if Miss Clergy thought she had done a smart thing
in makin’ so much out of Thurley because Thurley <em>used</em>
to be able to carry a tune, she had an awful awakening
ahead of her!”</p>

<p>“She’ll never get her married off to no one,” the village
further commented, when Thurley in a tight fitting
black habit had cantered up and down the streets on a
snowy white mare, while a moving picture man from New
York patiently lurked along the roadside to catch a few
poses. “Dan Birge ought to go down on his knees to
thank Lorraine for marryin’ him ... but does he?
Oh, no, when he gets down on his knees it’s only to tie up
Thurley’s shoe latches! Never mindin’ his business nor
his wife’s fadin’—nor the sport they make of him right
to his face—he’s a worse fool than they are!”</p>

<p>When the Corners became aware that Thurley’s terrier,
Taffy, had several sets of harness and sweaters, they
decided it was far more depraved than Dan Birge’s buying
a dog and having him ride in the front seat of the car.
Following on the heels of this discovery, the terrier had
a birthday party with a frosted cake and three candles,
and the newspaper editor admitted that they had sent in a
paragraph describing the event, fully expecting it would
be published. Upon being pressed for the details, the
editor said the sum total of the description read,</p>

<p>“Taffy Precore was the proud recipient of many handsome
gifts, including a set of white rubbers from Madame
Lissa Dagmar and an unusually attractive travelling coat
from Collin Hedley. Covers were laid for fourteen and
special out-of-town guests were Woofie Airedale, whose
guardian is Siri Mantenelli, the opera singer, and Ogre,
foster child of Ernestine Christian!”</p>

<p>But even this atrocity was matched—Dan Birge had
given Taffy an expensive feed tray and was present at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
the party. Hazel Mitchell took the day off to circulate
the rumor which developed into the report that
the tray was not aluminum but Haviland china with a
hand-painted monogram in the center! Had Dan been
seen kissing Thurley he could not have been more bitterly
condemned. Truly, Thurley Precore must get her
“comeuppance.”</p>

<p>Ali Baba summarized it one late summer’s day as he
watched Caleb, Polly and Thurley play tennis against
Collin, returned from Bliss’s hermitage, Mark and Lissa.</p>

<p>“Well, Betsey,” he said, leaning on his lawn-mower
handle, “these women covered with lady powder and
their dresses cut so low as to leave a fust rate advertisin’
space and these fellers a-whangin’ and a-bangin’ at their
fiddles or tryin’ to paint a pretty little blue lake to look
like a green icicle and none of ’em mendin’ a sock or
drivin’ a nail or carin’ about anything except who can
eat the most or laff the loudest, all of ’em thinkin’ ‘what’s
yours is mine and what’s mine is my own’—I want to
tell you Thurley’s got to get rid of the whole bunch,
if she’s goin’ to be worth a pinch of snuff. This way
she’ll neither be fish nor flesh nor good red herring!”</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII</h2>

<p>After a busy but personally unsatisfactory winter, the
war clouds for America gathering without pause, Thurley
admitted to Ernestine that she now understood the need
for nerve specialists, that she agreed fully with him who
has said, “a state of emotion without some action as
an outlet is immoral,” and she proceeded to drink more
black coffee and light wine than was good for her,
jeopardize her eyes by midnight reading of morbid Russian
novels and to carry on half a dozen affairs with
Mark as a sort of everlasting threat in Lissa’s direction.
Yet in her work Thurley had increased in ability and interpretation;
her <i>Juliet</i>, <i>Ophelia</i> and <i>La Tosca</i> were each
welcomed as superb achievements.</p>

<p>“Because, my child, you are burning up your personal
habits and tastes and nice Jersey cow nerves,” Ernestine
said with delicious melancholy. “I knew it was inevitable—you
could never stay the rosy-cheeked schoolgirl.
You’ll keep on using up your personal endowments.
Fame is a cruel stepmother to personal happiness and
you’ll be like the rest of us—quite impossible except
when you are before the public.”</p>

<p>At which decree Thurley fled to engage in a rousing
afternoon of ice skating with Mark, only to have Lissa
dart down on them with her purring, dangerous smile and
rescue Mark. She then sent him on an errand and drove
Thurley home in order to bestow a few feminine
scratches.</p>

<p>“I’m quite shocked, dearie,” Lissa began as they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
bowled through the park, “to think you’d take up with
the country bumpkin—really, with your career and looks
and the way you’ve been keeping your hand in with
Mark—” a bit of a pause here—“it seems to me you
ought to play for bigger stakes than that funny storekeeper
from Birge’s Corners ... aha, you are blushing!
I’m glad you admit guilt. All well enough when
you lived in that queer place and he was the richest man
in it. It is always well enough when one knows the richest
man, no matter how queer the place! But now,
Thurley, with the desirables you could—”</p>

<p>“Dan is an old friend—nothing more,” Thurley defended.</p>

<p>“Then keep your sentiment in check until you go back
to that queer place, for you’ve let him come to town to
see you—twice that I know about.” Lissa’s eyes
danced with delight.</p>

<p>“He comes to buy things for his store.” Thurley was
strangely alarmed at the secret being discovered.</p>

<p>“Does it mean he must see you? I suppose, poor lad,
he spends half his profits on you. What sort of a bonnet
will his wife have for spring? Oh, Thurley, if only
Bliss and Ernestine hadn’t tried to make you a nun and an
opera singer at once—wrong—all wrong as can be.”</p>

<p>Thurley felt it was her turn to scratch. “Anyway,
Lissa, Dan is harmless; he’s only a shopkeeper and I’m
not stopping his career.”</p>

<p>“You allude to Mark?” this with dangerous sweetness.</p>

<p>“Of course, you make him a mediocre dancer when
he’s the ability to be something fine and big—I don’t
know what, but I’m saying it is wrong for him to merely
dance and if you’d prod him the other way, I’m sure he’d
go. Besides, there’s no way out for you two, is there?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
I can’t imagine your marrying any one and it isn’t fair
to Mark—he’ll be dry rot before he knows it.”</p>

<p>“I married a mild person a long time ago; he let me
gain my freedom in my own way—it is more satisfactory
to be Madame Dagmar than plain Miss. I advise a
marriage for the sole reason that the world always takes
more interest in you; they are determined to find out what
made the marriage go awry. When critics begin to harpoon,
Thurley, get married, be divorced and you’ll find a
sympathetic welcome from the public.” She lifted her
gold chain with its dangling pencils, rouge boxes, tiny
brandy flasks and other trifles, swinging it back and forth
with a clinking sound.</p>

<p>“But Mark—is so young—”</p>

<p>“And I am so old? What an amiable little girl it is!
I can stay young as long as youth loves me.” She seemed
a wicked person hiding under a girl’s mask. “Don’t
worry about Mark—unless you happen to be in love with
him.”</p>

<p>When Thurley came home that afternoon, she found
a basket of flowers from Dan and a note saying he would
be in New York before June. Trips to New York were
not ordinary, easily managed affairs for Dan. He must
plan to be away without being suspected. Then he would
come to town and stay at a hotel, restless, eager and
thoroughly ashamed if he would but admit it, until Thurley
permitted him to see her, drove with him, entertained
him at her apartment, treating him in a half patronizing,
half genuine manner—not quite clear herself either as to
her motives or emotions. It was as impossible to think
of an actual intrigue with Dan Birge as to associate
schoolboys in the lower forms with being regular
brigands. True, they play at it—it is often their pet
pastime—but there is a prompt ending of it when the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
supper bell rings, wooden swords and false faces are
willingly left in the woodshed and plain Tommies and
Jacks cluster around the table!</p>

<p>So it was with Dan. Thurley, talking to him of this
or that, of anything save the things she would have liked
to talk of, now scolding him, threatening to send him
home, playing now that she was annoyed, now that she
was sentimental, now pensive or even angry,—Thurley
was doing a simple and a natural thing, proof of what
Ernestine had prophesied. Thurley was using Dan as
her whipping boy, outlet for her repressed and lonely
self. Dan was the ooze, some one human to whom
she could vent her whims and moods; some one wholesome
and clean-minded with whom she was entirely at
ease. She selfishly refused to think of the apparent indiscretion,
the lack of honor which she incurred when she
let him come from the Corners to stay in New York a
week while she showed him her restless woman’s self, and
let his own man’s heart learn to want her in new, dangerous
fashion.</p>

<p>Yet Dan was “playing” too. After all, Lorraine was
his wife and he had grown fond of her—used to her
would be more truthful and less romantic. She was
“mighty good to have about.” It was a relief to return
from New York with memories of Thurley as the great
opera singer, aloof, coquettish, temperamental, useless
save for her own work, and find the sunny little home
with Lorraine who never questioned his absence nor
shirked in her tasks. And if the tapestry furniture,
Queen Anne walnut and mahogany pedestals with plaster
statues got on Dan’s nerves when he recalled Thurley’s
strangely beautiful apartment, and Lorraine’s dowdy
frocks made him visualize Thurley in some wonderful
swirl of satin and lace—Dan realized that a man may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
be happily married and yet partly in love with some
one else at the same time. After this realization, he re-ordered
his life to fit the situation and his generosity to
Lorraine, like his manner, was dangerously kind and
thoughtful. The town, which would never exhaust Thurley’s
return as a topic for debate, said, fooling its narrow
little self, “I guess Dan is sorry for how he acted!”</p>

<p>Sometimes Thurley wondered if Bliss Hobart knew
of Dan’s visits. Once she was determined to make him
speak to her about something save her voice and decided
to tell him, but he forestalled her by saying that the
“songbirds” were giving him an album as a present and
although he did not care which picture most of them
selected for his gift, he had an idea he wanted Thurley
as her own self and not in any costume rôle—did she
mind?</p>

<p>They were in his office when he made the request, Bliss
sitting at his desk, as he had been sitting the first time
she had seen him, his fingers touching the little mascot
she had shyly presented that initial and wretched Christmas.</p>

<p>“Of course not,”—knowing she blushed unbecomingly.
“What sort of a ‘myself’ picture will your majesty
have?”</p>

<p>“Oh, just Thurley—when you blush do you know you
leave the rouge boundaries far behind? Please don’t do
your hair like oyster shells—Lissa is the only person
sufficiently vulgar to do so—and wear a close fitting
white turban besides!”</p>

<p>Emboldened by his request Thurley ventured further,
“What makes you order me about so? Am I always to
be a novice in your eyes?”</p>

<p>“I like to remember you as you were that first Christmas.
I do think, Thurley, Christmas is the only time I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
ever allow myself to be sentimental. Remember how
you looked in your blue serge, bright red coat with silver
buttons and an ermine tam tumbling off your head—a
splendid, real thing you were.”</p>

<p>“I’ve a picture taken then,” she said softly.</p>

<p>“Say it is mine and I’ll tell you a secret—the greatest
sculptor in the world is to be my guest very shortly. He
is here from his native land, Alsace-Lorraine, to gather
funds. He will speak to us because I’m going to give
him a party and at the same time Collin will have the
surprise of his life!”</p>

<p>“Not going to be married?”</p>

<p>“You women! Worse luck. I say—his picture,
‘Cupid and the Peacock,’ has been given the French
medal—and the master will announce it to him.”</p>

<p>“I’ll send the picture up to-morrow,” Thurley promised.</p>

<p>Hobart’s eyes were twinkling and tender all in one.
“Well, well, I’m more important than the great sculptor
or Collin’s success! Thurley, you are becoming dangerous!
Some day we shall have a great reckoning, you
and I,” and before she could tell him of Dan he had
bustled her out of the room, teasing her until she wished
she had refused him a photograph of her own self.</p>

<p>When Thurley sat at Hobart’s supper-table to listen
to the old master speak of Collin’s brilliant but heartless
picture, as he aptly described it, and then a little of
his treasure trove of art knowledge, as she saw his
stooped and wasted body wrapped humorously in a gay
shawl despite social custom, his face dark and dotted
with bumps and wrinkles as a New England field is with
granite boulders, wild white hair like white flames leaping
from his skull ... she missed the beauty and the
wisdom of his words. Instead, her young and attractive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
self recoiled from the physical appearance of this genius—the
price the master paid in order to concentrate, shut
out the things of romance, everyday diversion. As she
looked at the faces so intent on the great man’s words—words
like a benediction, it seemed, for he knew his
days were numbered—it seemed to Thurley she saw
naught but distorted, repressed or self-indulged expressions
and she must rise and leave the room, go into the
world a young, untalented girl doing some senseless, regular
thing and let those who should love her for her own
self speak out and prove their worth; that this drowsy
hum about fame and genius was nothing but a sedative the
unloved adopt to still the ache. She did not want to
sing better than any one else, better than Jenny Lind, so
the world told her, she wanted to sing poorly—and have
one man say, “I love you—”</p>

<p>Her hands clenched together under the cobwebby tablecloth,
as she realized that she had pledged to remain
aloof from such possibilities and, by so doing, she had met
the man whom she would always love ... she wondered
if she had betrayed her lack of interest in the
master. He was saying slowly,</p>

<p>“The two great influences helping me to attain my
mark were, first, my mother was my friend; then, when
middle age waned and inspiration seemed to have taken
flight, I heard Bliss Hobart sing, and so I went on.”
He was droning now over some technical thing but Thurley
kept hearing the words, “I heard Bliss Hobart sing,”
and with redoubled determination she promised herself to
rouse the man in him to speak to her, to give her fresh
inspiration, new courage—to go on alone.</p>

<p>“Everything is symbol,” the master was concluding,
“and there must be unity about all artists no matter how
disconnected and illogical they may appear on the surface.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
The artist must not trust anything but his eyes, for they
shall see the inner truth of whatever he is choosing to
depict. Ugliness to the vulgar becomes beauty to the
artist, for he sees the inner meaning of it and knows
that by portraying it faithfully he can destroy it. Take
the picture, statue, word description or acted part of
the drunkard, prostitute, the fool, the pervert—do they
not cause the sane yet inartistic person to turn away in
horror, resolved a thousand times more strongly to live
right?”</p>

<p>... Here Thurley’s mind wandered back to the old
man’s confession, “I heard Bliss Hobart sing,” and she
was lost in reverie until she caught again the master’s
earnest voice as he advised all young artists to see statuary
by lamplight in order to find the ivory shades of light and
dark shadows that daytime never reveals, not to put more
color in the sunrise than did Dame Nature nor carmine on
young lips nor fat greens in the summer foliage.</p>

<p>“For then,” he said, smiling wisely, “you cease to be
artists, but become dreamy and conceited liars! Be sincere;
no matter what you may believe, be sincere.” After
which he sat down as confused as a schoolboy, protesting
against the applause, admitting in an undertone to Ernestine
Christian that “America was too wonderful, her
food too sophisticated, her women too daring.” Then
Lissa tried to attack him from the other side with some
silly question which caused the old man to lapse into his
Alsatian jargon,</p>

<p>“Tè, Matame, je ne sais pas—”</p>

<p>Thurley left the party early; Caleb told her afterwards
that Bliss was disappointed for he wanted the master to
hear her sing. She took a delight in having cheated him
of the request. She went to her bedroom to rummage
among her belongings until she found an overposed stage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
picture of herself as <i>Violette</i> in “Traviata” and she inscribed
it to Bliss Hobart, sealing it in an envelope and
marking it, “For the album—could not find the other.”</p>

<p>She said her dutiful good night to Miss Clergy, looking
with magnanimous pity at the frail ghost lady who patted
her white, ringed hand and said as she had done so many
hundreds of times,</p>

<p>“How lovely you are, Thurley—and how proud I
am! You have never given me any anxiety—not for a
moment.... What a girl you are and what a joy it has
been!”</p>

<p>To-night, Thurley lingered a moment longer than
usual. “Do you think I shall never love?” she asked
nervously.</p>

<p>Miss Clergy sat up in bed, clutching her cashmere
shawl in excitement. “Love a man?” she asked breathlessly.
“Oh, my child, it would only bring harm!”</p>

<p>Thurley soothed her as if she were a child. “I won’t
break my promise—not even after I repay you—and
I’ll never repay you if I keep on buying pretties, will I?
What an extravagant goose I’m getting to be, vying with
every one else for the brightest trifles!” She was talking
more to herself.</p>

<p>Miss Clergy misunderstood her meaning. “Never repay
me, Thurley! What do I want with money? All I
have will be yours, now do you understand? All I
have!” she whispered hoarsely.</p>

<p>“Go to sleep, there’s a dear,” Thurley said swiftly,
“and when you watch my flirtations, remember they are
only to make the stage loves the more real.” Turning off
the light she left the ghost lady to her haunted memories.</p>

<p>Half the night Thurley searched among her possessions,
finding and destroying notes from admirers, Dan’s
boyish, imploring letters, her own childish diary she had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
kept the first year in New York, Bliss Hobart’s few mementoes—the
crayon sketches Collin had made of her
abroad, Ernestine’s letters. She reread her press clipping
book, her expense accounts, personal memoranda;
she added and deducted figures as if she were a scientific
accountant. Then she walked into her clothes room and
looked at all the lovely, rainbow things of becoming richness;
she opened her jewel case and stared at the glittering
bits of beauty within. It was as though she were
taking a complete inventory of one Thurley Precore,
prima donna.</p>

<p>She undressed herself slowly, never taking her eyes
from her image in the glass, plaiting the brown hair into
two braids, each as thick as her own arm. Then she rose
and quoted quickly the master’s telling command,</p>

<p>“Be sincere—no matter what you may believe,” adding,
“so that’s decided—no matter what comes,” startled
at the insolent assurance of her eyes. If one could
have seen her face as she slept one would have noticed
foremost of all that a permanent sneer seemed painted
on the scarlet lips.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIX</h2>

<p>Whatever Lorraine thought concerning Dan’s frequent
absences and his attitude regarding his home and what
happened therein, she still followed the path of the Victorian
era and kept her own counsel. Nor did any one
try to disturb her gentle self by the agony of doubts. For
one reason the “genteel grafters,” such as Cora, Hazel,
Josie and Owen of the art shoppe fame, came to Lorraine’s
home only for what advantages could be obtained.
Why then disturb her who gave them the advantages?
There might be an end of them if they did. To be sure
they gossiped among themselves and the societies and
lodges with vivid imagination and a generous manner of
embellishing a truly innocent but unique situation—a
high-minded, spirited man too high for his town yet too
undisciplined for the city who haunted the footsteps
of a high-minded, spirited woman who had become big
enough in abilities for the entire world and who was
dying inwardly of ennui and heart-lonesomeness, who took
this mild sort of affair as the one genuine and refreshing
thing in her hurried, <i lang="fr">de luxe</i> existence. Neither of these
young people realized the harm it incurred. They
cheated themselves into believing it “merely palship” or
“an expression of individuality”—a very nice sort of
garden and not wild oats affair!</p>

<p>Sometimes Thurley met Dan with a zest for his boyish
mannerisms, his telling of the rise in wool goods, what a
splendid housewife Lorraine was—only she didn’t
understand things—how jealous he was of the basso who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
made love to Thurley on the opera stage. Sometimes she
looked at him in disdain, the strange sneer on her lips as
she thought of what a dull existence was Dan’s, what a
lark it was to see him strive to make as good a showing
as the young millionaire who was hopelessly infatuated
with this Thurley Precore, boasting at his club that she
would wear his necklace or his flowers before the season
ended. The vampire which is in all women and which is
not a sinister quality only to be raved about as “a rag
and a bone and a hank of hair,” had for the time being
become supreme in Thurley. Dan did not understand
this—any more than he understood why he was unhappy
when he was near Thurley and always thinking
about Lorraine and why, when he returned home, fortified
a thousand times by the blessed memories of Thurley’s
beauty and the stolen moments he had claimed, he
was unhappier still.</p>

<p>Dan would return to his immaculate, prosaic living-room
where Lorraine would greet him and inform him
all in the same breath that Lydia Hoyt was engaged and
Lorraine would give a kitchen shower—and did Dan
notice how the veranda posts sagged, hadn’t he better
have a man come up and see about them?—oh, yes,
there was something wrong with her car, well—she had
let Owen drive it because he had deliveries to make ’way
out in the country—beefsteak was three cents higher a
pound than last week and two of the church deacons had
resigned because they couldn’t have their way about the
music.</p>

<p>After which Dan would slip away to unpack his bag
and Lorraine to prepare his supper. There would be an
abundant, well cooked meal on the prosaic table with its
nightmares of hand painted peppers and salts and cut
glass monstrosities, the water pitcher heavily banded with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
gilt. After eating his fill, Dan would depart to smoke in
peace and wonder what Lorraine would think of Thurley’s
new frocks and the baskets of flowers which forever
adorned her rooms, of the bizarre friends and their
weird ways—he would end, however, with the somewhat
hopeless consolation that Lorraine had about as
much imagination or capacity for artistic enjoyment as
the old lady who, upon seeing mountains for the first time,
merely said querulously,</p>

<p>“Dear me, if any one ever started to roll—”</p>

<p>For Lorraine would have probably remarked, after
viewing Thurley’s apartment, “How in the world does
she ever get the work done!” letting the panorama of
joys and possibilities sweep on uncomprehended.</p>

<p>Therefore, Dan had decided, after very arduous sophistry,
it was not wrong to see Thurley, to keep her in his
bewildered heart as a sort of lovely idol, something set
apart from the Corners and his house-and-garden life—something
as different as the scarlet tanager or the jewelled
dragon-fly is different from the barn-swallow or the
field-daisy! Each has its own place.</p>

<p>But when spring began to hint of its appearance and
Dan had been in New York over Easter, while the Corners
gossiped about his absence, although Lorraine
bravely occupied the front church pew and wore her new
silk gown, Dan came home prepared to tell Lorraine that
he would probably be away very often during the summer.</p>

<p>He waited until the work was “done up” and Lorraine
brought her everlasting handiwork to join him in the
den. The den itself was sufficient to make Dan’s nerves
rebel—it had been furnished a few months after their
marriage, an upstairs bedroom transformed into an inquisition
chamber, as he told Thurley.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span></p>

<p>Dens in such hamlets as the Corners offer no <i lang="fr">raison
d’être</i> save when a cartoonist gets a peek at them or the
family scapegoat turns up unawares and is made to occupy
the combination divan and folding lounge.</p>

<p>Lorraine fondly pictured the den as an ideal place for
Dan to come and rest—“A real man’s room,” she explained,
“where they smoke and play cards—and talk
about things!” It was adorned by Indian heads, an oak
table with a prim scarf done in poppies and maidenhair
fern, a lounge with pillows made from cigar ribbons and
college pennants, all placed in undying positions of rectitude,
glass candlesticks with pink shades, a shining little
ash tray and match box, a shelf of detective stories and
old magazines, an easy chair in old rose velours, two
fragile rocking chairs, some grinning lithographs of cowboys,
African savages, Christy girls and bulldogs placed
at exact intervals about the pink flowered walls and
dimity curtains criss-crossed and crisp from recent washing
to shut out the light!</p>

<p>Seated here, this April evening, a hundred thoughts
clamoring for consideration before the task of telling
Lorraine he was to be in New York a great deal, Dan
pretended to play solitaire and keep up a desultory conversation
about the way a neighbor trained a pumpkin
vine over his woodshed and captured the village improvement
prize!</p>

<p>The absence of sympathy between them seemed a relentless,
chilly wind whipping on his treasonous speech,
all the more so because Dan had no truly logical excuse.
On the face of it, what more could a man demand?
That is, if one were magnanimous about the Indian heads
and sofa pillows, what right had he, a small town shopkeeper,
to wail his heart out for a genius?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, ’Raine,” he said abruptly, shuffling the cards with
a fillip, “I may have to run off for a few days in a couple
of weeks—all right?”</p>

<p>Lorraine did not answer; she bent her head over her
work.</p>

<p>Dan looked at her sharply. “Isn’t it all right?”
His voice had that dangerous gentleness at which she
always winced.</p>

<p>“Is she coming back this summer?” She dropped
the sewing.</p>

<p>Dan put aside the cards and came beside her. Under
the flare of the reading light her face seemed thinner and
more childish. There was a miraculous subtlety of features,
a hidden delicate something which he could not
analyze; he felt boorish, brutal, as absurd as when he was
one of Thurley’s guests at a party and every one really
made polite game of him.</p>

<p>He kept looking at Lorraine, wondering why this
change had come about; tired purple shadows were under
her eyes, the eyes themselves were soft, shining things
seeming to look far beyond him.</p>

<p>She raised her hand, crumpling the sheer, white slip on
which she was sewing.</p>

<p>“You mean Thurley,” he stammered, “well—I—I
don’t know, dear, you see the Fincherie is Miss Clergy’s
house and of course ... oh, <em>’Raine</em> ... now, I understand,”
his eyes staring at the tiny, gossamer dress!</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXX</h2>

<p>With an armful of projects under way, Hobart had
little time for Thurley during the winter. He met her
with a sort of “You’ve got beyond me but I don’t
think I’ll bother to chase after” attitude, praising her
when she did well or keeping his silence when she did
some showy, foolish thing, food for press agents. He
was noncommittal as to Dan Birge’s visits—as Miss
Clergy had been, since the latter looked upon them as a
particularly choice part of her revenge, for here was a
man debarred from marrying the woman he loved, yet
following her hopelessly whenever she permitted, Pied
Piper fashion.</p>

<p>When Lissa had hinted of unsavory things to him, Hobart
dismissed the matter with a careless speech and a
shrug of the shoulders. This he had learned to do long
ago, whenever Lissa came prattling of some imaginary
scandal which pleased her tarnished mind. There had
been the time she tried to convince Hobart that Collin
really did not paint his own pictures, but hypnotized Polly
into doing it and thus kept her starving in a garret, hopelessly
in love with Collin and Collin playing a modern
Svengali. Lissa had endeavored for many days to make
Ernestine believe that Caleb was the storm center of a
liaison with a Broadway actress, thus ferreting out Ernestine’s
state of mind concerning Caleb and promptly running
to Caleb to tell him, ever so confidentially, that Ernestine
was in danger of drinking herself to death, poor
woman,—too bad she loved that wretched gypsy violinist<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
who had played with her in concert work—could nothing
be done about it? The world had soon learned not to
value Lissa’s information, paying no heed to her hints of
Sam Sparling’s dreadful actions or that Bliss Hobart did
not go to his hermitage in the Maine woods—why, there
was the silliest little movie actress at San Diego—living
in a perfect castle, too—</p>

<p>So Hobart, well versed in tactics, when Lissa approached
him on the subject of Dan and Thurley, managed
to switch the conversation on to the information that
Mark had danced so poorly his position as premier was
threatened and Lissa had better adopt the diet of a Belgian
refugee if she still wished to look her best in tailored
things! Lissa, ousted for the time being, would depart
to vent her wrath on the shoulders of her maid or Mark,
who was, in truth, dancing poorly because he was bored
and he felt dancing was not a man’s life-work when other
things kept whispering themselves to him—and, hang it
all, why did a clean cut, wonder girl like Thurley let
Lissa pull her around by the nose anyway?</p>

<p>In a spirit of half earnest, half flippant revenge for
Hobart’s neglect, Thurley sang poorly at a salon concert
at which Hobart was the host. She so resorted to Lissa’s
mannerisms that Caleb took notes on his cuff for future
use.</p>

<p>Thurley knew the concert was a failure since she was
to be the one to make it a success. She refused to meet
Hobart’s disappointed gaze, pretending to be engrossed
in listening to a Russian agitator telling of his escape over
the frontier.</p>

<p>The next morning, when Thurley was debating
whether or not it would be convenient to have Dan visit
her so soon again, if this summer was to be spent in
shocking the natives or, as Caleb had urged, selecting a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
site for a permanent country home and seeing it well on
its way to completion by fall, she lifted the telephone receiver
to answer its ring and heard Bliss Hobart’s voice—his
teacher voice—saying,</p>

<p>“Come over at ten, Thurley, you’ve a lot to answer
for.”</p>

<p>“Suppose I won’t come?” she retorted, delighted at
the prospect.</p>

<p>But he had disconnected. She deliberately made herself
late by overdressing. A mad hatter’s model of a
bonnet in blue and a frock of rose taffeta with a coat to
match furnished her with the proper scenery, she admitted
to herself. She slipped in to where Miss Clergy industriously
sat knitting army socks and told her she was off
for a coaching lesson.</p>

<p>“A coaching or a dancing lesson?” Miss Clergy asked
mischievously.</p>

<p>“Both,” Thurley declared.</p>

<p>She found Hobart in his inner study; he was playing
an old gavotte and greeting her with a curt nod.</p>

<p>“Well—is a luncheon to follow the lesson? You
must have thought I’d keep you all morning. I’ve a
pupil at eleven.”</p>

<p>Thurley sat on one of the little peasant chairs and
pouted becomingly.</p>

<p>“I dress to suit my mood. Some mornings I have a
desire for a winding sheet; this morning I wanted rose
taffeta and sapphire velvet.”</p>

<p>Hobart smiled. “Does Miss Clergy ever row about
your adorers?”</p>

<p>Thurley flushed, saying in a more natural voice, “Not
exactly. To her mind it is the more enhancing—keeping
mankind at bay. And it settles a distressing question
for me.... I daresay I’d make a cropper of marriage,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
most of us do. This way, I do as I like,” turning
to contemplate the empty fireplace. “Must I be coached
this morning?” she added. “My throat feels scratchy
and I have a benefit concert to-night.”</p>

<p>“It wasn’t your voice—but yourself.” He ended
the song and, rising, took an opposite chair before the
fireplace. “I am going away earlier than usual this year
because of some work in England; making art aid the
war. If I don’t see you again, let me give you a little
moral coaching which is all you need to set you right.”</p>

<p>She would have interrupted, but he held up a protesting
hand. “Age before camouflage,” he pleaded. “For
a long time, Thurley, I have been watching you. You
have come now to where you feel that an utter disregard
of morals is really preparation and a necessary frame of
mind in order to win the violet crown—”</p>

<p>“What do you mean by the violet crown?” She did
not look at him.</p>

<p>“One of my pet names.” He became boyish in manner
as he always did when prevailed upon to speak of the
things nearest his heart. “I’ve a lot of pet names—and
secrets—tucked under this salt and pepper hair of
mine. A long time ago, I sang rather well,—nice people
have said I sang as well as yourself, with as much ease
and as little training. That was why I understood you.
My mother was an Italian and my father an American,
but we lived in Italy to please my mother and, after
my father died, she felt she could not bear to leave the
blessed memories, for they had been ideally happy.” He
seemed lost in a reverie from which he roused himself
with an effort to continue:</p>

<p>“After my mother was gone and I was singing as well
as yourself and every one making quite a fuss over me
and wanting me to tour America,” he seemed to dread<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
even the saying of the words, “I loved a woman who was
older than myself and who sang, too, but not well—more
like Lissa. I loved her very dearly and, of course,
I believed in her. But she was an art intriguer and not
a worker and she said she loved me merely because my
golden voice meant real gold—for her to spend....
After awhile,—I suppose I became a tedious, dreamy lad
too occupied with ideals,—she found a man with a great
deal of money and no more knowledge of music or art
than a lapdog has.... Without telling me, she went up
to Paris and they were married and she laughed at my
moonings and made fun of my ideals.... For a long
time I was ill, absurdly so, and when I was well, my voice
was gone,” he tried to speak lightly, “but in its stead I
had a vision.... Does that sound too superlative? It
does to myself, for it is one of the things words spoil the
full meaning of; it would take music to express it, a sonata
inspired by the three oldest sounds in the world—”</p>

<p>“What are they?” Thurley asked, feeling the simple
girl from Birge’s Corners again, a <i lang="fr">de luxe</i> Topsy!</p>

<p>“The wind, the death cry of a warrior and a woman’s
sobs,” he answered so quickly she knew it had been clear
to him for a long time. “No one will ever write the
sonata, so words must do their best. At least, I choose
to whom they shall be said. For it is as if you were
looking into the very soul of me, as a mother does when
she first sees her newborn child, the instant when the
mysterious bond between them is formed for all time,
despite all happenings.”</p>

<p>Thurley leaned forward in her chair, her blue eyes
serious. “I shall understand,” she promised.</p>

<p>“I have never told any one all I shall tell you to-day,
because I could not bear to have them jangle and disagree
in silly, stupid ways—like an auctioneer trying to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
prove that the contents of a shrine were not of intrinsic
value but merely worth while as souvenirs! Because I
think it is worth while, I shall tell you. All the others,”
he shook his head, “were not worth it! Nor could I
have told you at the beginning—you could not have
understood. Now, you are at the crossroads, flirting
with each direction, undecided which way you are going
to travel.”</p>

<p>“I shall understand you,” she repeated. To herself
she added, “Because I love you!”</p>

<p>“It seemed to me as I pulled myself together after
the fever and cast about for another way of being useful,
that true art was not symbolized by a laurel wreath but
by a violet crown—I daresay the notion started from
my admiration of the wonderful enamelled cups used in
cathedrals—lavender and sapphire. So I named the
symbol for genius, the crown typifying supremacy, violet,
as the ecclesiastics interpret it—humbleness, for those
who possess true genius must be ever mindful of the
sparrow’s fall. It has seemed to me the violet crown
could be, figuratively, won only by such a nation as America,
which, like the Child in the temple, commanded respect
and consideration of the elders—or the Old World
with its shallow reasonings as to art. For the Old World
has, to my mind, treated art and its artists somewhat
after the fashion of Barmecide’s Feast—the Arabian
Nights’ tale of the prince who bade the beggar sit at the
snowy table a-glitter with golden service and, lo, when the
platters were lifted, the plates were devoid of food! So
it is with true art—we have had wonderful achievements,
but we have not yet made ourselves realize the
moral significance and responsibility of art and artists,
that has been as devoid of justice as the golden plates of
Prince Barmecide were of food—” He paused.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span></p>

<p>Thurley was eager to speak. “Why, then, can I
understand your vision?” hoping for but one reply.</p>

<p>“Because you are one of the vanguard! Another of
my secrets! There are never many of the vanguard, and
we are not always rich or great or talented. Sometimes
the vanguard of civilization are humble and their earthly
record most uninteresting. But have you never thought
to yourself there were just a few, rare souls who—who
understand? Who can smile at the trials the world seeks
to escape from and sometimes sob at the vapid joys for
which the world strives so unceasingly? The vanguard
can make the most out of little and belittle the most.
They seem to glimpse the coming trials of the nation and
her resultant triumphs; they are never given to cowardice
of flesh or spirit. As a general’s military vanguard
moves further along the battleline, so we, the altruistic
vanguard, must be ever ahead of the times in thought,
deed and prophecy. It is not always a pleasant rôle—to
blaze the trail. The vanguard are usually misjudged,
ridiculed and never idle—”</p>

<p>“So the first vanguard was the group at Calvary who
gave defiance to the mob.” Thurley forgot the personal
issue between them.</p>

<p>He nodded, well pleased. “In science, theology,
economics, art, so on, we always find a few members allying
themselves distinctly with each great cause and these
few dare to see and to say wherein lie the errors of the
past and the possibilities of the future. Let you and me,
Thurley, as artists help America as a nation to the winning
of the violet crown.”</p>

<p>“This war—” she began.</p>

<p>“Ah, not this physical war, for it will be over within
a short time—so to speak. America will enter and soon
surface peace will result. But long, long afterwards—when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
art assumes fairly normal proportions and consideration
and the world lapses back into the old ways—what
then? Some one has said the French have taken
this war as an immortal martyrdom and the British as a
bully, well worth while game—then let our nation take
it as the chance to win the violet crown—first by the
necessary sacrifice and change in extravagant, thoughtless
living which will prepare our minds to be ready for the
great moral battle long after the fields of Flanders are
recreated into fragrant orchards.”</p>

<p>“Then you did not want to preach to me,” Thurley
sighed with relief.</p>

<p>“This is all a part of it,” he warned, “for you have
strayed far from the vanguard. First, to finish about
myself. For I have been glad the world lost an excellent
tenor because he might have been a foolish one. I
am better placed as I am; but you, Thurley, are running
amuck. Why this shallow flippancy? This false basis
of theories, mistaking shadow for substance? Because
you hear such and such a great <i lang="it">diva</i> bore a child for a
crown prince—that this artist acts under the influence
of morphine and that one paints only when addled from
absinthe—you must not pursue these phantoms of self-indulgence—and
you who sit there looking confused yet
combative, you are at this very moment halfway inviting
an intrigue with an honest country lad—Dan Birge!
Can you not remember that scullery maids as well as
prima donnas dabble their virtue in cheap stains; there is
nothing distinctive about it?”</p>

<p>Instantly at war with herself, yet happy because Hobart
was speaking to her, Thurley, of her personal tangles,
she began a spirited defence, using Lissa’s blasé
theories.</p>

<p>He waved them aside, answering in a brusque manner,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
a contrast to his dreamy fashion of a moment ago, “You
say, ‘I am different—on an independent train!’ Then
so are we all, rich man, poor man, beggar man, thief.</p>

<p>“Why applaud, throw gold, even title a man or a
woman who, despite remarkable ability, has betrayed
every simple tenet of faith and mocked at the very subject
matter which gives them their laurel wreath? We
need a new standard for art, Thurley.</p>

<p>“As the air has been conquered for a flight, a
dozen things of science, a broader version of theology,
let us make the standards of personality of importance
in considering genius. Ultimately we should not
lose. The artists themselves would be the spiritual
gainers, if forced to live up to the ideals they so conscientiously
and glibly prescribe for every one else. You
hear of a tradesman who abuses his family and his business
invariably falls off as a result. Yet we encore a man
who has cynically betrayed a young girl and laugh indulgently
when reading of his drunken escapades. ‘But
what a Romeo!’ we say. ‘We must excuse him—an
artist, you know.’ There is an end of it. Is it not true
that in politics nothing damns a candidate more than a
whisper against his good name—his name, mark you,
not his abilities? In religion, what ruins a clergyman
more than the rumor of the little choir girl—? In
everything else the world has attempted to deal out justice
regarding the equation of personal and professional
life, but at the mere mention of talent, genius—temperament—even
a bobbed-haired musical comedy actress—the
public sinks giggling like a schoolgirl into an orchestra
chair and becomes ineffectual, blind, duped—immoral!”</p>

<p>Thurley made no comment, but she rose and showed her
nervous tension by walking rapidly up and down the floor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span></p>

<p>After a pause Hobart added, “If we are to make
American art permanent, we must make American artists
hold to the best in themselves. That, Thurley, is my
vision! That is what you must do, for you are of the
vanguard and you have true genius. Of course there
would be a time of temporary disillusionment for art,
with every one scrambling about and crying, ‘Help-ho—surely,
not <em>me</em>!’ After the readjustment, when the craft
of artists realize that the public demands clean-breathed
lives of them and the surplus of amateurs have been
beaten back into the ranks, I see an art so ennobling and
enduring that all other glories pale beside it—an art of
which America alone is capable—virile, innocent not
ignorant, mystical yet practical. In truth America’s sixth
race can be the inspiration of the bleeding, older world.
That, Thurley, by degrees, must be our part in reconstruction—the
winning for America of the violet
crown.”</p>

<p>Thurley paused in her walking of the floor.</p>

<p>“But when one is so young and—when—” She
faltered, all the wild-rose self of her returning, like a
child reluctant to confess its misdoings.</p>

<p>Hobart took her hands in his. “The personal twist
to any problem is for the person to solve; no one else can
estimate it as well. Only to you have I told my vision,
confided my hopes. Do not disappoint me,” he would
have added more but the rap at the door recalled him to
the eleven o’clock lesson.</p>

<p>“Au revoir,” he said gaily, “and if I do not see you
until fall—”</p>

<p>“You must see me; you cannot leave me at the crossroads.”</p>

<p>“You are making yourself walk backwards to them,”
he contradicted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span></p>

<p>“You did not finish about yourself,” she refused to be
conscious of his appointment, “the woman you—loved—that
part of the story—”</p>

<p>“I told you all I have ever allowed myself to remember,”
he corrected, the inner illumination vanishing and
the rather cynical man of the world in elegant morning
dress remaining.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXI</h2>

<p>Thurley went directly home instead of keeping a
luncheon engagement with Ernestine. She wanted to
spend the afternoon in remembering all he had said.
The greatness of his vision and the new standard for art
had not impressed her as much as the moment when he
had taken her hands—or told of his false love. Then
Miss Clergy’s promise crossed the clearness of her reflection,
blurring it badly; Dan’s bucolic letter on her desk
marred her thoughts as well—so did the flowers from
Mark, the handsome gift book from some one else; a
myriad of incidents and engagements came to spoil the
reverie. As sacred to her as the vision which had been
shared with her, Thurley kept telling herself, “I am of
the vanguard ... and I love him ... no other man
can tempt me ... I love him, therefore I can live up to
his vision and help him ... for he is sadly limited. He
merely expresses what some one else must do.... I love
him,” and when the charming question hinted itself to
her,—“Suppose this man of a great vision and grave
purpose, burned clean of youthful tragedy, should love
<em>you</em>—what then?”—Thurley admitted that vows were
brittle things and that if the circumstances so fell out she
would not hesitate to prove the statement.</p>

<p>The next morning when she was writing Hobart a note
trying to express something of all she felt towards his
vision and his influence, as Dante said of Virgil, “their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
guide, their master and their friend,” Lissa dropped in
for a call.</p>

<p>“Bliss sails at noon for England,” she informed Thurley.
“Isn’t it wonderful to be all important, war or no
war? They want him to patch them all up with patriotic
art—I suppose he’ll come back an earl in spite of himself—”</p>

<p>Whereat Thurley felt as heartbroken as a girl deserted
by her bona fide lover, as she tried to chat pleasantly and
not betray her disappointment. She entered again the
squirrel cage of doubts and subterfuges until she felt as
absurd at having seriously considered being one of the
vanguard as one who admits having won a husband
through a matrimonial agency.</p>

<p>Lissa’s way was quite comfortable—uneasy lies a
head which does not wear a becoming hat was the greatest
depth of her philosophy!</p>

<p>So Thurley dragged the summer through, wondering
why Dan had ceased to write to her, imploring her to
return to the Corners or permit him to visit her in New
York. In the true sense Thurley was glad Dan had not
written, although no woman can ever quite forgive a man
whose interest in her ceases. She was piqued, on her
mettle to sing her best and disprove Hobart’s flowery
vision, as she had told herself it was, to sing so well and
live so flippantly that she could say to him with truth,
when he returned, “Your vision is impractical,” and
when a certain multi-millionaire, a chewing-gum king
he was, to make it the more humorous, made love
to Thurley and plied her with attentions, Thurley did
not hesitate to flirt with him publicly until Sunday
newspapers, despite the war, devoted a page of pictures
and lurid writing with repeated exclamations
about “the young <i lang="it">diva</i> whose vow never to marry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
has not kept her from being soul mate to the chewing-gum
king!”</p>

<p>The chewing-gum king was boresome after a little;
horse-racing, good wine, pretty women without brains,
clothes trees upon which to display his wealth, were the
extent of his possibilities. And Thurley, without hesitation,
proceeded to pass him over to willing rivals who
had watched the apparent progress of the affair with
scantily concealed envy.</p>

<p>Miss Clergy had not gone to the mountains but stayed
with Thurley, who flitted restlessly from one watering
spot to another, appearing at the private affairs for war
charities, now and then running into Caleb or Ernestine
or Collin who, likewise, seemed to be having a table
d’hôte vacation, a little of everything and none of it
satisfying.</p>

<p>Hortense Quinby, again in charge of Thurley’s apartment,
and Polly Harris proved the only exciting events
in the long holiday. Without warning Hortense left
Thurley as suddenly as she had attached herself to the
retinue, a desertion which brought Thurley into town to
see why this sudden resignation of a now valued member
of her staff.</p>

<p>She found Hortense in a khaki uniform with innumerable
brass buttons and a mock knapsack across her chest,
her restless eyes sparkling with a new eagerness as when
she had pleaded to become necessary to some one who
was already famous. Hortense was to do land duty in
behalf of the French war orphans, only, as she told Thurley
forcibly, until America entered the war and overseas
duty confronted her. At last she could prove her worth
to the world! The land duty in behalf of the orphans,
as nearly as Thurley could make out, was to appear publicly
as often as possible to solicit subscriptions from all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
who passed by,—a more exciting form of the occupations
of old men to be seen on side streets, a restaurant
sign harnessed on both chest and back, announcing the
wonders of pot roast and noodles for fifty cents—pie
extra.</p>

<p>“But just when you’ve learned to be of such use to
me,” Thurley urged, “the way you keep everything going—why,
Hortense, weren’t you happy?”</p>

<p>At which Thurley was treated to the initial outburst
of Hortense’s emotional spree.</p>

<p>Briefly, it was this: The chance for the great adventure
was presenting itself to women whose lives had had
neither adventure nor romance. And if romance and adventure
had not been theirs, it was their duty as individual
souls to create it, woo it, pursue it, anything to
obtain some smart and stinging knowledge of the world
at large. It was better to wear out than to rust out, this
strange, middle-aged rebel said, her long, thin hands fondling
the buttons of her toy uniform.</p>

<p>“Ah, but I thought it was for the orphans,” suggested
Thurley, who had, unostentatiously, paid for the support
of half a dozen of them.</p>

<p>Well, it <em>was</em> the orphans, true enough—but the orphans
were a means to an end—there, that was the situation!
Being third rail to fame was not satisfactory, it
was like leading a hungry man outside a restaurant window
wherein are displayed three-inch steaks flanked by
asparagus and keeping him there, close to the food it is
true, but separated by a window glass which, if he breaks
it, means jail!</p>

<p>Being associated with genius had merely whetted her
appetite for expression, nor was she alone, she added, all
over America were women realizing that the opportunity
for self-expression, freedom of speech and action was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
theirs; they would proceed on the quest for adventure,
something to be an everlasting antidote against the drab
pattern of their ladylike lives! Few suspected this rebel
germ was quickening in the flat, thin chests of conscientious,
rubber heeled librarians, middle aged, a trifle unwholesome
spinsters like Hortense—but it was true.
Whether or not it was milk for French orphans, which
was a worthy cause playing into the hands of the restless
searchers, a cause was being given them and take it they
would!</p>

<p>So Hortense, for the time being, passed from Thurley’s
life with Thurley pondering after she had stamped
from the room with a ringing, military tread and given
Thurley her headquarters address, adding that she would
see trench life or commit suicide!</p>

<p>When Thurley sought out Polly to beseech her to come
and look after things, particularly now that Thurley was
to begin coaching for her new title rôle in Liszt’s “Saint
Elizabeth,” she found Polly giving a party royal in her
attic, celebrating being left a small legacy by a maiden
aunt. The aunt had also left Polly a letter expressing
her opinion that her niece had been nothing if not a fool
to have left a good home with a decent furnace for a tenement
and a daily diet of macaroni.</p>

<p>As Thurley looked at the hilarious feast, well under
way, she laughed in spite of herself and wondered whether
or not the aunt’s shade was walking restlessly! For
Polly in a new frock as brown as Spanish fish nets on the
Santander sands, was pouring out claret with a lavish
hand and pressing alligator pear salad and jellied chicken
on her nearest guest, the table abundantly strewn with
every eatable known to luxury.</p>

<p>“Polly’s pretending her opera has been a success, I do
believe,” a more practical guest whispered to Thurley.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
“She’s determined to burn her money up as fast as she
can; she’s loaned us all ten dollars—”</p>

<p>Thurley found Polly quite determined to pay no heed
to her aunt’s letter.</p>

<p>“Why should I remember I come of gentle people?”
she asked, her brown eyes sparkling naughtily. “I’d
rather have one or two glorious parties, treat myself to
all the music I want for a season than to go snailing back
to Painted Post and live in a cottage completely surrounded
by neighbors. I’ve run wild too long, Thurley
dear—don’t look so disappointed. Why, you beautiful,
lovely thing, what right have you to show me the error
of my ways, you with a king’s ransom on your fingers this
minute? Yet, Thurley, when I look at you and summon
my Scotch second sight to lend me wisdom, you seem fey
to me, fated as the Scotch know the world. Shall I tell
you your <em>possibilities</em>?”</p>

<p>“It’s the claret,” Thurley insisted. She did not want
to talk about herself because she did not seem a struggling,
interesting human being like the rest.</p>

<p>“No, it’s not claret but second sight. Bliss knows I
have second sight; he’s often asked me for opinions—for
everything but my operas,” she added a trifle bitterly.
“Now you do seem fey, as if you ought to become a rosy-cheeked
matron, the sort that has a big, brick house just
packed with young people who all confide in you, and a
nice, gentle sort of relatives, linen closets with lavender
bags between the snowy piles, jam closets, rooms with old,
soft rugs and mellowed furniture, all kinds of books and
pictures and nothing so wonderful that art dealers would
ever employ burglars to borrow. Just the kind of things
that years afterwards would cause your children to say,
‘Oh, that was mother’s—I shall never give it up,’ or
‘Here is her shawl. How she laughed at herself for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
huddling so eternally in it! Let’s keep it in the cedar
chest she had as a bride, she’d like to have it so, I’m certain!’
You understand, Thurley dear, the lovely common
things inspired by some one not common! There,
that’s quite as smart as Caleb himself could have said it.”</p>

<p>Forgetting her errand and Hortense, Thurley repeated,
“It’s the claret, Polly—and you’re quite mad....”</p>

<p>She rushed home to practise scales diligently, remembering
with every thump of the keys that she was never to
marry—tum-tum-tum, and that Bliss Hobart was a visionary
dreamer—tum-tum, art never could be placed on
a moral, idealistic basis, never—ti-ti, she had no idea of
trying to be one of the vanguard because how useless it
would be when one was tied to a ghost lady—tum-tum-ti,
that wretched bohemian of a Polly had unsettled her—ti-ti-ti,
anyway, Bliss had said he would not consider a
vow to a ghost lady as binding—tra-la-la, yet after confiding
his great secret, why did he rush off without a
good-by, expecting her to do what? Why didn’t he go
scold Ernestine or Caleb or Collin, some one besides herself—ta-ta-tum,
she finished with a final thump and a
superbly clear note which brought Miss Clergy to the
door to applaud.</p>

<p>For the first time Thurley turned from her in recoil.
She seemed a jailer preventing Polly’s vision from coming
true—and what a lovely vision it had been!...</p>

<p>“Thurley, are you ill?” Miss Clergy was asking.</p>

<p>“I’m tired of everything,” she answered, without controlling
her temper, “of singing and New York and myself—and
you,” like a walli-walli windstorm she swept
out of the room, remaining alone until she could laugh off
her outburst by a light, humorous explanation of a tight
slipper or the alarming story told by the weekly weight on
undeniably uniform scales!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span></p>

<p>When Hobart did return, he was a tired and not easily
enlivened man whose summer had been spent overseas
planning things calculated to counteract the effects of
“military poison ivy,” so he said enigmatically. He met
Thurley with seemingly weary interest and a disapproving
shake of the head when she tried again to convince
him that her way and Lissa’s way was the best—as well
as the easiest—and the chewing-gum king only one of a
handful of “pet robins!”</p>

<p>Then he looked at her in her sophisticated maze of
gold cloth and gave a boyish laugh. “If you told me
you were totally depraved, I should only laugh,” he said.
“You are trying to fool yourself into thinking yourself
a first water adventuress, so how can you expect to fool
me? Come, come, what terrific things have you allowed
to happen to your voice! We shall have to send you to
the nursery to begin again! So Lissa coached you! I
knew the voice assassin’s marks of violence.”</p>

<p>He busied himself with getting Thurley’s voice in
shape for her opening night. They did not talk again
of the vision or Thurley’s snap judgment regarding life.
Once Thurley ventured to say he looked tired and he answered
that when a man is used to really ‘living’ for
three months of the year, to be shunted into another
channel tells on his disposition, but he would weather it
all right and he was very glad to have been of service.</p>

<p>“I think one of the hardest things in the world,” he
added, “is to be the man highest up! To have no one to
whom you can go and dump your budget of woes and
worries. Sometimes I long for a limited, brainless task,
devoid of responsibility, sure of an uninterrupted lunch
hour and a sick benefit.”</p>

<p>Wondering over his words, Thurley reached her apartment
to find a letter from Dan, hesitating before she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
opened it to wonder what had made him break the long
and unexplained silence. Then she found her answer.</p>

<p>Dan and Lorraine had a son! Dan had written Thurley
to tell her he loved his wife as he had never loved
any one before—not even Thurley. He had confessed
to Lorraine his unloyal, wayward impulses and she had
forgiven him. Their joy over Boy was so great that he
wanted Thurley to be friends “with the family.” He
ended almost naïvely, he hoped that she would understand
and be happy for them all!</p>

<p>So a new, engulfing envy, seconded by Polly’s little
prophecy, beset her and during the winter and spring
there was but one outcome, Thurley worked as she had
never worked before, deaf to pleas about her health,
bitter towards her admirers, aloof from Hobart and the
others of the family, working without pausing, as if to
drown the very whisper of the things nearest her heart.</p>

<p>With the declaration of war came a multitude of surprises
and readjustments regarding the family. To
Thurley’s surprise her own interest was poised, critical as
if the war were past history and not in the making. Miss
Clergy was “not interested,” the Civil War had written
itself for all time on her ghost heart. Mark was not
going, he declared; Collin took the rôle of a misguided
pacifist; Caleb plunged headlong into a war novel, “The
Patriotic Burglar,” upon which he was to realize a fortune
and retrieve some very asinine losses on the stock
exchange. “The Patriotic Burglar” was to be called
upon to pay his income tax, and how explain the income of
a hundred thousand a year, partly obtained by the theft
of Clementine Van Schaick’s pearl necklace! Now Clementine
was a little volunteer worker at the income tax
office—enter High Ike, the patriotic burglar, they meet—and
here romance fairly skidded under the speed of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
Caleb’s typewriter. No soldier was to be without a copy,
commissioned officers would be expected to carry five at
least, and that was as far as the war affected him!</p>

<p>Ernestine took the pessimistic view one would have
expected of her. The country was going to the dogs,
she declared, really mistaking her own intensive selfishness
for the failure of the country.</p>

<p>Hobart, who had already been fighting “art battles”
abroad, had little time in which to express opinions and
Thurley, having word from Hortense Quinby that she expected
to sail for overseas shortly, began to reflect on the
social readjustment which would result from the needed
advertising of charities, loans, what not, since the only
logical advertisers and workers would be the hitherto
domestic women who would now step beyond the firesides
and lift up their voices.</p>

<p>Thurley came to think more concerning Hobart’s vision,
the final victory for America in establishing a new
morale for permanent art than she did of the need for
guns and men, although she generously wrote checks and
sang gratis. As for Lissa, she believed in having things
to do credit to her patriotism and her complexion simultaneously.
A toque of blue poppies, a red tulle veil worn
à la odalisque and a besashed and bepleated bit of white
scenery for a frock, the American version of Nanette and
Rintintin, faithful mascots who saved Paris from the
Hun, worn on a silver cord, these completed her opinion
of the war and in this outfit, to Thurley’s surprise and
amusement, she appeared one warm May day to say languidly,</p>

<p>“Being meatless day, I’ve taken the rat from the cat
and am here for a cocktail. There’s a dear! Oh, hum,
all my pupils are rushing off to be motor corps girls or
kitchen drudges or something like that. When I have to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
appear enthusiastic and call them all little Joans of Arc,
I feel like saying, ‘How can I conserve a cup of mush
spilled on the kitchen oil cloth?’ and let them go forth
properly shocked to the last bit of braided uniform!
What does Bliss say about the opera? I should think
with all those horrid German singers sent packing there
would be a big opportunity for us home-growns. Bliss
has always been obstinate about my appearing. I’m as
sure of success as you are.”</p>

<p>Before she left, Thurley understood the part Lissa
meant to take in the war—to go overseas apparently to
sing for the boys and in reality discover and capture a
widower duke for her second husband.</p>

<p>“Why not?” she asked. “I’m sure women have the
right to seek their fortune?”</p>

<p>“Not at such a time. They should be sure they are
needed before they go across to eat up sugar and beef
and wheat—even to take up space. There should be
an examining bureau where every one could be proved a
hundred per cent needed.”</p>

<p>“Ridiculous! Think of the chance to know titled
women. I wouldn’t wonder if I went to London after
the war—a few titled patronesses and one is established!
Of course you are bound to meet them over there, when
they are all scrubbing floors and cooking. It’s so easy
to become socially elevated these days! Look at the
people right in America who have slaved at the Red
Cross rooms to become socially exposed! Oh, I know
the majority are self-sacrificing, but the other side is
worth a place in history, too.”</p>

<p>After she left and Thurley opened the window to
banish Lissa’s heavy and synthetic perfume, she thought
of her cold-blooded determination to find a duke, a disabled
duke would do if his title was sound, and marry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
him or become friendly with blue-blooded women of England
who welcomed all who came to serve!</p>

<p>To condemn a class is not only useless but ethically a
grave error. No one has ever given it credence save
fanatics or disgruntled, long-haired socialists. But to
argue both sides of the question, giving each fair representation
and admit the errors and the virtues of both—that
is common sense.</p>

<p>So Thurley sat this May afternoon while the city
throbbed with its new turmoil, thinking of many things,
all of which related to Hobart’s prophecy—that America
must win the violet crown, definite recognition by the
Old World that America had established new standards
for art, independent of the frayed and tarnished rules
which had, in a sense, caused present bloodshed. As a
nation’s art progresses, the nation’s virility weakens,
so history has proved, Thurley reasoned. When art
reached a state of so-called perfection, commercial, physical
and religious supremacy of the nation dimmed—because
the foundation for that art was not made of common
sense rules but fantastic and self-indulgent exceptions.
Let the foundation for art be moral even if limited
to begin with, inspired by self-sacrifice and with sincerity
its determining motif and that nation can advance
in art without fear of decadence. She went to the window
to close it, looking down at the busy, broad street
where strange posters met her gaze, women in uniforms,
women stopping pedestrians to beg for the cause, women
making speeches, boys screaming out something and waving
banners, while echoes of a popular military song
floated up to her,—all gay anesthesia for the horror of
the war. The great and needed romance of war had
taken its clutch on America; reality was left unhampered
for the battlefield. That was the great division of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
forces. From now on anything tinged with military
trimmings would be accepted. Fortunes won by a trifling
penwiper made of red, white and blue cheesecloth! An
actress however infamous of character and threadbare as
to ability would be lauded and her salary tripled when
she screeched camp ditties or waved a flag! Pictures
with the flag would sell, pictures with soul and peaceful
backgrounds would be shoved aside, books such as Caleb’s
would flood the market, military diaries would come in
droves to the editors’ payroll. For the time being art
would be a necessary factor in arousing emotions and sustaining
interest. It always had been so, it always must
be so at such a crisis.</p>

<p>It occurred to her that if Hobart’s vision could have
been realized before this crisis what a mightier, more
direct influence true art would have in rousing the commoner.
For it would be an art of spiritual sincerity and
no one would be forced to discriminate among a myriad
of near-art wares and mercenary efforts in patriotic
guise. The peasant whose taste for opera and pictures
is unsullied until he mingles with the conglomeration
which this over-generous nation offers is to be preferred!</p>

<p>And afterwards, Thurley thought,—strangely enough,
when peace had come—would the vanguard of art
be brave enough to banish forever the surplus wares,
false standards and begin anew?—for these swashbuckling
profiteers would be loath to cry quits.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXII</h2>

<p>An hour later Thurley discovered herself in bed, a
doctor watching her and Miss Clergy in the doorway, her
face gray with apprehension. A nurse whispered she had
fainted while standing at the window; that there was no
need for alarm. The doctor added that she had brain
fag, nothing serious if she would go away to some place
where she could be pulled together. After more suave
remarks and those little sugar-coated pellets left behind,
he departed and Thurley sent the nurse and Miss Clergy
away, tossing restlessly and wondering if she could make
them understand that she would not go to a milk-fed
sanitarium where nurses sneaked about in rubber-heeled
shoes and one had to exclaim over sunsets with the other
patients, to say nothing of bulletlike little biscuits and
health foods and the talk on “Iceland Moss” given by a
convalescent missionary!</p>

<p>When a wild rose tries to become a hothouse variety
there is certain, some time during the transition, to be a
bad scratching of thorns which was all that ailed Thurley.</p>

<p>In the morning Bliss Hobart dropped in to see her and
Thurley brightened so visibly that the nurse left the
room, grinning superciliously.</p>

<p>“Bother opera things,” Bliss said. “I’m really glad
you fainted yesterday; you fainted enough for me, too,
didn’t you? I was just considering getting up on top of
Grant’s Tomb and dancing a Highland fling—masculine
form of nerve fag.... I say, Thurley, do you know
you’re coming with me to my hermitage? I’m leaving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
to-night and we’re to bully Miss Clergy into being chaperone.”
Here they both laughed at each other like children
and the pellets almost lost the sugar coating in
wrath at the small part they played in curing this wild
rose person! “Oh, yes, you are coming. I was just
leaving for Blessed Memory myself when they told me
you were ill. A month there will set you right.”</p>

<p>“You mean the place you disappear to—”</p>

<p>“And Lissa hints of a harem, a dope den, a gambling
lair and what not? Yes, ma’am, Blessed Memory is its
name. You’ll be there this time to-morrow. Remember,
rouge boxes and high heels not admitted.”</p>

<p>He left her to thank her kind fortune she had had
sense enough to faint and bruise herself slightly. Why,
oh, why, had she never thought of doing so beforehand?
She was humming as she waited for her maid to come and
get a steamer trunk.... Miss Clergy watched from the
corner of the doorway unawares. But what she thought
she kept to herself.</p>

<p class="tb">Blessed Memory, buried in the wildest part of Maine,
with the nearest post office entirely unpronounceable,
proved to be an advance sample of paradise. Being perfect
there was nothing complex about it—and very little
to tell concerning it. Time flew, the hours tumbling over
themselves like babies at play. It was exactly like the
thirsty traveller coming upon the ice-cold mountain spring
and drinking his fill with no comment but the satisfied and
grateful, “A-a-h, man alive!” So it was with Thurley.</p>

<p>It seemed that Hobart had come into the wilderness
prepared to prove that he could make it habitable, as he
told her. After he had built a shack, found his food and
water, lived by himself for weeks at a time to experiment
with bark, twigs and logs—learning the call of wood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
beasties and forgetting the cries of men—he permitted
himself a few extravagances in the way of tools and furnishings
until Blessed Memory, as he called the small,
silvery shingled house set in a sand dune like a great
moonstone in palest gold, came to be a reputable habitation
where he took refuge each year, “living,” he said, in
order that he might “exist the rest of the time.”</p>

<p>Miss Clergy was ill at ease in her nunlike bedroom
without ornament and scant of furnishings. But she
found thought for reflection in watching Thurley and
Bliss as they went off to try for fresh fish. Her queer,
bright eyes would blink rapidly as if a succession of unpleasing
thoughts had attacked her conscience and she refused
to give way to them. When they would return
and hallo for her to answer, she would usually take refuge
in the plea of eternal neuralgia and leave them to their
own ways for the remainder of the day!</p>

<p>The rooms contained old-style braided rugs and a spinning
wheel which, to Hobart’s delight, Thurley knew
how to use, thanks to Betsey Pilrig, old blue china and
pewter, a square piano on which Hobart played jingling
tunes while Thurley sang them as gloriously as when she
played missionary with Philena. The beds were mahogany,
so was the fire settle, and there was an outdoor
Dutch oven which her host insisted on using, a pump and
a well and a tiny barn where his wheezy little automobile
rested when it was not chasing up and down country
roads in search of supplies.</p>

<p>He had no real neighbors nor did he wish for them.
He had bought enough acres on all sides of Blessed
Memory to secure him freedom from molestation. He
wanted to feel, so he explained, that even lavender
and black velvety butterflies, great, golden bees and humming-birds
might come and go at will.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span></p>

<p>There were no books or even writing materials in the
house. “When I have to go in to town for supplies, I
get my extremely urgent mail and reply to it while at the
post office,” he explained. “But I wish nothing inky
about the hermitage.”</p>

<p>Thurley, who had first viewed the little house and the
wild surroundings with dismay as to what she would ever
do with herself, fell to work within a few days and became
a busy Martha engrossed with house and outdoor
work, plying the axe while Hobart was away, replanting
flower beds, picking berries, climbing trees to sit astride
some sturdy limb and dream of nothing, actually to forget
language, as it were, entering the realm of delicious
thought, rejoicing in merely singing <em>sounds</em> as did the
birds, instead of clumsy words needing to be phrased
and accented.</p>

<p>“I never knew any one could be so busy in such a
wilderness,” she told Hobart one late afternoon when
they had tramped clear to the sea-coast and sat resting
before they journeyed homeward with the aid of barn
lanterns.</p>

<p>“Because you and I and other creatures who live by
their wits most of the time and have the tasks of physical
existence performed for them, need to remember that one
can almost see and feel the truth of eternity ... the
eternal seasons, Thurley, the ever-dying, ever-reviving
blossoms, the migration of the birds, the continual progress
and continual decay of all forms of life—that is
what makes us really seem so busy. Because most of the
time we are nibbling at a fragment of this supreme truth,
boxed up in a steam-heated apartment with a man and a
maid and an engagement tablet to be our aids, we sing
some silly opera and return to the apartment convinced
we are quite indispensable to mankind. We need to come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
to such a place as this and humbly realize eternity.
That is why I named the little house Blessed Memory,
because I carry the thought with me when I lock the door
for the long, white winter.”</p>

<p>Thurley was silent, the most sympathetic answer she
could have made. She was mentally quoting,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Cool girdles and crests of the sea gods,</div>
<div class="verse">“Bright hollows of billowy foam”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">—as suitable for the scene.</p>

<p>It was a quiet sea haven they had found. Bliss had
tramped there many times, he told her. Around them
were wet sea wrack and pungent bog myrtle, tall protruding
cliffs with the green grass clinging to them and dusky
birds incessantly slipping about. The sea itself was a
shadowy, gray wilderness broken with rosy trails which
led to darkish mystery. In the sky a star trembled.</p>

<p>“Tell me more,” she demanded childishly.</p>

<p>“What about? I must seem as bad as a complete
reading course shipped on without warning,” he began,
playing with pebbles, “but do you know what I was
thinking, Thurley? That the art vanguard are certain
to succeed, that this time of strife should not be for
merely freedom of seas and colony disputes—it is the
time of discord in which all matters shall have their hearing.
And then, one sees absurd glimpses now and then
that make one want to shout for joy—”</p>

<p>“What?</p>

<p>“Oh, a life insurance agent with a well worn copy of
Keats in his inner pocket or the apparently frivolous hairdresser
who reads Ruskin’s essays with the girl who sells
fountain pens during lunch hour—or a very famous
prima donna who finally admits that the shadow can
never be the substance and that works without faith are
dead, too!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span></p>

<p>Thurley was thinking in disconnected fashion. “Tell
me, will the war level class as well, so that it will result
in there being no very rich or no poor?”</p>

<p>He shook his head. “We must always have wealth
demonstrate herself with freedom; we must always have
class. Let each man be what he was best intended; we
cannot have one class, one rule, one creed any more than
one dimension. The Cause who made such eternal contrasts
as the snowbound north and orchid-decorated tropics,
the sagebrush desert and the French vineyards—has
the example not been set us for all time? There
must be wealth and its opposite poverty and the sunny,
useful medium running between the two and understanding
each alike. Remember, player and worker are like
the wings of a bird, equal and necessary. Class must
exist the same as vicarious atonement—the mother bearing
the child, soldiers fighting for stay-at-homes. The
ancient but sometimes forgotten or denied unity of the
race is the belief in immortality.”</p>

<p>It was dark; the sea with the white rocks rising out
of the water here and there gave the effect of the black
and white cathedral front at Siena. Hobart lit their
lanterns and urged a homeward journey.</p>

<p>“I don’t want to go,” Thurley begged. “Tell me
more—”</p>

<p>“Yet you try to make me think you do not believe my
vision,” he said, “that you will not be like the soldier
in the old song, who did not halt but ‘he gave the bridle-reins
another shake.’”</p>

<p>“Tell me why artists have different lives from the
world in general,” she retorted.</p>

<p>“There are some isolated, superb but lonely souls
whose work robs them of human ties and leaves them
chaste yet wistful. True, again, on the firm yet terrible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
foundation of expiated sins is genius often laid—the
splendid blossom of the tree of experience. The greatest
leaders have often, to their enemies’ delight, pleaded
guilty to a youth of folly, small faults, petty actions—and
yet there has come an awakening and with the handicap
of the past as a ballast, they forge on to the heights.
I sometimes think handicaps are as necessary for an
artist as ballast for a balloon. Without them we
would sail upwards beyond ordinary comprehension and
the whole purpose would be of no avail. Let us stay
sufficiently earthbound to insure usefulness and proper
responsibility.... Come, Thurley, even if the poets say
the children of dark and the children of light tread the
same pathway, our lanterns may fail us and we would
have to scramble to find the house.” He helped her up.</p>

<p>“You mean, too,” she said, not content to stop the
argument, “that artists should set the example—as
well as prescribe one—”</p>

<p>“Those who are not sufficiently developed to perceive
the higher cosmic laws must have man-made laws to teach
the first great principle—which is to obey. Obedience
either forced or voluntary is the first requisite in moulding
character. Those of us who can glimpse the higher laws
must also keep annoying man-made ones to help those
less developed by our example.”</p>

<p>Thurley began picking her way along the beach, singing
softly:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">If all the seas were one sea—what a great sea it would be!</div>
<div class="verse">If all the trees were one tree—what a great tree it would be!</div>
<div class="verse">If all the axes were one axe—what a great axe that would be!</div>
<div class="verse"><span class="smcap">And</span> if all the men were one man—what a great man Bliss would be!</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Three weeks later when Hobart drove Thurley into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
the nearest station, he asked almost timidly if she felt
it had been worth while.</p>

<p>“So worth while,” she said, “it showed me what I
must not do.”</p>

<p>Miss Clergy gave a sigh of relief as she was settled
on the local train running down to the main line.</p>

<p>“You look like a little girl again,” she told Thurley.
“I’m sure it was very kind of him.... Did you ever
fancy he might fall in love with you? Imagine how
distressing it would be for him—knowing your position!”</p>

<p>Thurley resigned herself to the inevitable, and as they
jolted onward she thought of how very great and how
very small was love and that from atom to apostle the
personal equation would come blundering in on one’s
most sacred thoughts.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXIII</h2>

<p>The remainder of the summer found Thurley undecided
as to what she should do next and not having Hortense
as an aide-de-camp and with Polly still squandering
her legacy, Thurley stayed in town to collect her
faculties and study new rôles.</p>

<p>She found that women were chattering about “finding
the group spirit,” pointing with envy and emulation to
the soldiers who had found “the group spirit” and were
working together for the cause. The germ of unrest,
masquerading under the altruistic title of “group spirit,”
was prevalent among all the women Thurley knew and
those of whom she heard.</p>

<p>Even Ernestine came to explain incoherently that she
had cancelled the season’s engagements to sail for France—“to
help”—anything that was needed, play or amuse
or scrub floors, Thurley dear, and was noncommittal as
to her disorganized interests at home or her personal
qualifications to serve in this capacity. Thurley accepted
Ernestine’s good-by with a sense of amusement. Thurley
herself did not feel she was slacking although it
would have been difficult to explain just why she did
not. She, too, had brought the “blessed memory”
with her from the hermitage, acting as ballast for the
chaos which prevailed about her.</p>

<p>A feeling of age had also claimed her. She seemed
to see beyond these struggling, enthusiastic but deluded
women who were sincere in their efforts, yet forgetful
that to serve one’s immediate circle of dependents is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
best way in which to serve the larger cause. Thurley
saw ahead to the psychological struggle taking place in
one year, three, five—who knows?—when these restless
spirits, suffering from repression of emotion or ennui
had rushed pell mell with a bevy of excuses and
accomplishments into the teeth of the fight and the fight
had unexpectedly ceased and their adventure was at an
end.</p>

<p>She did not try to argue with Ernestine to stay at
home and when Mark came to say good-by, a few mornings
later, saying he was to dance and give athletic
drills overseas, she said very faintly,</p>

<p>“But is war a pink tea? If I were a soldier and I
saw an able-bodied man dancing about in a toga to give
an imitation of Greek handball, I’d ask him to get into
the trenches with me or quit. After all, Mark, you are
going because Lissa is going!”</p>

<p>“Lissa is after a duke,” Mark said lightly. “How
about one of these floor-scrubbing duchesses? What
about yourself? You might capture an earl,” drawing
on his cream-colored kid gloves. “Fancy Bliss, who
blew in yesterday fit as a fiddle, declaring he would stick
along at the old game right here.”</p>

<p>Thurley’s face must have showed her joy.</p>

<p>“Oh-ho, so Lissa is right,” Mark laughed. “She always
contended that it was Bliss whose word was law
with you!”</p>

<p>Thurley put up her hands in protest and dismissed
him, sending Lissa a good-by present and evading a possible
interview. It did not seem as if she could endure
these vapid persons who were rushing over to gain fame,
excitement, copy or a worth-while matrimonial alliance!
She saw, in truth, the result of Bliss Hobart’s words, that
were the foundation of art of sterner stuff regarding personalities,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
these cluttery amateurs and intriguers would
be, perforce, engaged in some industry and not foot-loose
to follow the procession. The really great souls whose
work would ennoble the cause could go forth unquestioned
and certain of results.</p>

<p>The morning’s mail brought her consolation—a note
from Collin, characteristically brief and with a pencil
sketch of himself, very knock-kneed and bulging of eye,
clad in uniform.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">Dear Thurley (he wrote)</p>

<p>After all, women aren’t the only ones to change their minds.
Don’t laff! Or I’ll cut you off without a helmet. I’ve traded my
brush for a bayonet. It got me. That’s why—selah,</p>

<p class="right">Collin.</p>

</div>

<p>“Good boy,” Thurley said as she finished reading
the note to Miss Clergy, “and I suppose Polly will march
in with the Long Island Legion of Death behind her,
making war on me if I dare to smile.”</p>

<p>“But you won’t have to stop singing, will you?” was
all Miss Clergy answered. “There’ll be enough people
left at home to listen to you?”</p>

<p>“I won’t stop,” Thurley promised gently, adding
to herself, “my singing is Miss Clergy’s form of an
ooze!”</p>

<p>She was wondering these days if, when she met Bliss
Hobart again, the holiday at Blessed Memory would
serve to bring them into closer understanding or if,
as after so many other rare moments, there would follow
a desultory friendship with the same harsh taskmaster
and critic speaking no more of visions.</p>

<p>Later in the day he did call on her, the same elegantly
dressed Mr. Public Opinion who was so besieged with patriotic
duties and enterprises and enmeshed in a mass of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
detail regarding the reconstruction of grand opera, law
suits impudently presented by dismissed Teutonic songbirds,
the revival of English and French music and the
possibility of a new prodigy, that he seemed to Thurley
to be twin brother to the man who had played and worked
and thought in the fashion of a hundred years ago—in
a hundred-years-ago setting.</p>

<p>“Polly is busied with a surprise,” he told her, “a
horrible war opera, I presume. No one seems able to
convince her she is hopeless. And that ridiculous devil
of a Collin has gone to fight, bless him, while Ernestine
has fallen prey to war-madness which is besetting emotional
and idle women and she will return with a new
stock of morbidity—because she has tried to do something
which she had no excuse for attempting.”</p>

<p>“What of Mark, Lissa, Hortense?” she persisted,
laughing.</p>

<p>“Banish them from my thoughts—” he looked at her
critically. “Yes, it did you good. Now that I’ve set
the example, why not follow it? Find a wilderness
and build a house in the middle of it. At eighty-two
you’ll have the critics wrangling as to whether you are
your own daughter!”</p>

<p>“Where shall I go?” she asked rather pointedly.</p>

<p>“Aha, you want to poach on my reserve? You can’t
do it! Take your own home town; isn’t it wild in
spots? Seems to me you used to say so. Take twenty
acres and bury yourself in it. Do the things we did those
four weeks.”</p>

<p>“Birge’s Corners!” So, he was to remain aloof.
Birge’s Corners where she had returned in foolish triumph
and ostentation—Dan and his son and Lorraine would
be there, a harmonious trio! There was no place for
her at Birge’s Corners.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’ll consider it,” was all she said.</p>

<p>“I came to tell you of Sam Sparling,” Hobart added
in a gentler tone. “Evidently you have not heard?”</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>“It happened while we were away. Had a nervous
collapse—a stroke as well, and was battered up for
keeps—all one side. Seems he had tossed his money
around without thought and he was left stony broke.
So they gave him a royal London benefit. The war
paused long enough to honor the old chap. People
came hours before the performance and waited on street
curbs, brought their lunch and all that. A stall was
as hard to get the day of the performance as a slice
of the moon. Baxter says it was as great an event in
its particular way as a coronation. They all turned out,
great and small, old and young, to give Sam a valedictory.
And now blush, Thurley. They even had your voice
on a talking machine singing, ‘Drink to me only with
thine eyes,’ and it was encored! There, doesn’t that set
you up? I can’t tell you the exact programme, but every
great artist available appeared. There was every one
from a coster singer to the finest Shakespearean artist.
And then the curtain rose for the finale—all the artists
were in tiers and dressed in evening costume. Up high
on a sort of throne sat our Sam, weak and not quite
resigned yet to the truth of what had happened but
gamey old Sam in a tuxedo and a gardenia in his buttonhole!
The house burst into one sobbing roar—for
he was <em>their</em> Sam Sparling and they were going to prove
it.”</p>

<p>“What did he do? Oh, why weren’t we there?”
Thurley cried.</p>

<p>“First, the house sang the street gamin song Sam had
sung when a lad, a catchy tune with a refrain of,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">‘Let me hold your nag, sir,</div>
<div class="verse">Or your little bag, sir,</div>
<div class="verse">Anything you please to give—</div>
<div class="verse">Oh—thank ’ee, sir—!’</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“He used to do a clog dance with it and have that
laugh of his thrown in for good value. Well, the people
forgot his Shakespearean triumphs and his drama work;
they just sang the old song between their laughing and
crying. Then two men helped Sam to half stand, a terrible
effort for the dear old chap, but the house rewarded
him,—they sobbed louder than ever. All Sam said was,
with an echo of the old street gamin laugh, ‘Thank ’ee,
sirs’—and then he fell back—dead! The excitement
was too much ... and the money will go to the soldiers.”</p>

<p>“But that,” said Bliss, after Thurley managed to
stop sobbing, “isn’t the thing that hurts the worst.
That was a superb ending—just as Sam himself would
have staged it. But the very next day, the leading daily
announced they would run a series entitled ‘Sam Sparling’s
Breach of Promise Suits’ as told by an ‘old beau’—and
there you have what I’ve said in a nutshell—the
wrong the man Sparling did to his better self living
after him, the good forgotten, undervalued. All due
to the present day system of advertising and standards
for artists’ personalities.”</p>

<p>“What will it be after the war?” Thurley added.</p>

<p>“It will be the duty of every person to discriminate
between the army, whether military, spiritual or mental,
which has won the cause and what I name the jumblers-in,
emotional hoboes who have profiteered or indulged in
mental orgies or distorted patriotism in order to market
inferior wares—” He was about to say more when
Miss Clergy came in, her sharp eyes looking at Thurley’s
tear-stained cheeks. Being a mere man, Hobart fled!</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXIV</h2>

<p>In September Thurley did go back to the Corners,
Miss Clergy with her, but she did not take the maid, the
accompanist, the extra motor car with which to startle
the natives.</p>

<p>“I keep humming the old tune:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">‘Home, boys, home, in the old countree,</div>
<div class="verse">’Neath the oak and the ash and the spreading maple-tree,’”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">she confessed to Bliss the day before she left, “so it’s
home I’m going and I’ll probably race back to town and
wonder what madness moved me.”</p>

<p>Her concert season did not begin until November,
for which she was thankful and with Miss Clergy amicably
assenting to the return, Thurley sent word to reopen the
Fincherie.</p>

<p>Inspiring her return was the longing to see Dan and
Lorraine and the harmony which their child had brought
them. Envious though she was and starved with the
longing to have some one of her very own, Thurley had
come to judge things with a broader gauge. She wanted
the satisfaction of saying to Dan that she was glad for
him and she understood. She must tell Lorraine that
she was truly friends with “the family!”</p>

<p>She knew her world would have ridiculed her ridiculous
conscience, deeming it more essential that she reopen
the flirtation with the chewing-gum king or find out a
more distinctive method of advertising. But to Thurley
the contented handshake of Dan Birge and his wife’s
smile was more to the point. So she drove quietly into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
the Corners one warm, early fall day when every color
in Dame Nature’s paint box had been employed in the
bordering trees of the Fincherie lawn. She said to Ali
Baba who met them eagerly,</p>

<p>“I’ve come home again.”</p>

<p>Nor did she waver from that manner. She went into
the bedrooms and proceeded to settle Miss Clergy and
herself with as businesslike an air as her own maid had
done, stopping to ask Betsey and Hopeful questions which
she knew would please, telling them again and again that
it seemed good to “be home.”</p>

<p>“I guess you’ll find a lot of changes,” Betsey said,
lingering in the room. “I guess you’re changed some
yourself,” her kind old eyes looking at the girl shrewdly.</p>

<p>“Come, Betsey, you’re going to accuse me of growing
old! Now what is it—let me hear the worst?”</p>

<p>“No,” Betsey pushed her glasses on to the top of
her head so as to see the better, “it’s a change of heart—like
I’ve heard tell about,” unconscious of Thurley’s
desire both to laugh and cry, “a real change of
heart, I guess.”</p>

<p>“Was I that bad?” Thurley asked penitently. “I
thought only the town drunkards had changes of
heart—” she paused, realizing it was not fair to tax
Betsey’s sense of humor. “It is this, Betsey, I’ve grown
up and with all the wonderful things life has given me,
I have no one of my own, so,” she finished bravely, “I’m
determined to belong to a town ... now, Betsey, tell
me, what are my chances for having Birge’s Corners fall
dead in love with me?” amused at Betsey’s struggles to
be honest yet not offend.</p>

<p>“I guess you give ’em an earful the last time,” Betsey
began. “You know, Thurley, they ain’t up to the
new ways—and you—you—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span></p>

<p>“You’re afraid I don’t understand,” Thurley hugged
her—because she wanted to hug some one and Betsey
happened to be handy. “I do understand—but remember
the old railway crossing advice, ‘stop—look—listen’—”
here she handed out a dress pattern for a
present and took a deep interest in the debate as to
whether there should be box pleats or a circular skirt!</p>

<p>Within a short time Thurley became both unconscious
and disinterested as to her own change of heart. For
she discovered that here was an opportunity to study
first hand and in unsuspected fashion the war madness
which was taking its toll of house-and-garden folk destined
to do their bit by stay-at-home effort. The news
that Dan had a commission did not surprise her beyond
a certain pride, almost as if she had been instrumental
in her arguments for his going. She thought that Lorraine
probably cried a little and tried to convince Dan
his duty lay at home because of the boy; she could picture
Lorraine’s distressed, pretty self as she coaxed Dan
not to go “and get killed” and Dan’s sentimental side
warring with his manhood. At any rate he had gone, so
Betsey told her, watching Thurley’s face for some evidence
as to her state of feeling. Also he was making the
very best first lieutenant in the army—for was he not
the first commissioned officer from the Corners?</p>

<p>There had been a quota of village lads, some of whom
Thurley remembered, who had gone and there was a
fudge club organized by the village maidens which yielded
weekly so many pounds of sugary delight to be forwarded
to the training camps. The social club was a
Red Cross center, the lodge rooms were forwarding
station for garments and relief funds, no corner of the
town but what had scrambled personal possessions into
a corner to make way for impersonal duties.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span></p>

<p>As Thurley saw these evidences in even the shut-in
hamlet, she reproached herself for having mere visions
of a time far ahead when America should win the violet
crown, the time when the future generations would recite
in history the events of the war of wars and then
say with as much assertion as they told of the enemy’s
defeat, “A renaissance in art was noted in America
during the reconstruction period, art was placed on a
more permanent, moral basis, there was a widecut destroying
and discouragement of all pursuits and achievements
which did not conform to a high moral and spiritual
idea. For the first time in the history of the
world, our people demanded of artists more than their
work, they demanded a conforming to moral law so
that the number of art workers became fewer and the
public was relieved of superfluous art intriguers whose
influence was a menace.” So would the children recite
and when the teacher would ask: “Who inspired
this great movement?” their answer would be, “Bliss
Hobart, he named it the violet crown—the crown for
supremacy, violet as the eccelesiastics interpret it—for
humility.”</p>

<p>Thurley could almost fancy she heard the answer being
made, as glorious a feat as there ever was to be,
to have children speak one’s name with admiration, to
have shown America over-rich in all physical attributes,
as taking for her spoils the greatest lesson of all, re-educating
her artists so they might draw on the wonderful
and hitherto barely skimmed surface of her astral or
mystical energy which lies waiting for all true idealists.</p>

<p>The third day after Thurley’s return, when she was
card-indexing her thoughts in order to begin her concert
tour, wondering how to convince the town that she had
returned to be one of them and that no matter how great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
the world might call her she did not belong to the world
but to Birge’s Corners, she finally decided to go to see
Lorraine.</p>

<p>She was amused at the situation as she slipped into a
frock like the beautiful green blue rust which comes on
copper and put a gold piece in her purse for the boy.
She, Thurley Precore, like a wistful village spinster, going
to call on the son of her erstwhile adorer! And she chose
to carry out the illusion by walking through the streets,
nodding at passers-by and pretending not to notice their
astonished glances.</p>

<p>The Corners could never quite forget the birthday
party for Taffy, although Taffy had long since ascended
to canine realms above.</p>

<p>She came upon a gathering in front of Dan’s store—she
had wanted to go inside to buy some trifle and
recall the atmosphere of the old days, even if Dan’s
desk was now locked and deserted, the days when a
willful girl used to dance in and call “Cohoo” up at
the young proprietor. But there was a platform in
front of the showcases and women were sitting on it,
all of them in uniforms. They had a barrel for a table,
a pitcher of water and glasses, and pamphlets which they
flung out into the crowd at intervals. Boy Scouts were
standing in line and singing lustily the doughboy favorite,
while a small person also in uniform directed them
with wild gestures:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Oh, there was a little hen and she had a wooden leg,</div>
<div class="verse">The best little hen that ever laid an egg,</div>
<div class="verse">And she laid more eggs than any hen on the farm—</div>
<div class="verse">And another little drink won’t do us any harm—</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>As the crowd cheered, the small directress turned to
face them and speak in a shrill, excited voice about the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
need for funds, lapsing into slang when other superlative
failed her, striding up and down, her soldier hat
on one side and her hair dishevelled. It was Lorraine
Birge! Thurley felt as if the world were approaching
an end as she discovered the identity of the
speaker. Beside Lorraine were Josie Donaldson, Hazel
Mitchell and presently Cora Spooner appeared to play
an uncertain trombone solo, while a queer youth in white
flannels and a dangling eye glass began passing the hat—it
was Oweyne Pringle of the art shoppe!</p>

<p>He gurgled his delight when he recognized Thurley.
“You’ll have to sing for us—the crowd will be twice
as generous ... oh, do, it will please Mrs. Birge.”</p>

<p>“Tell Mrs. Birge I will wait for her after the meeting.”
Thurley weakly dropped the gold piece she had
intended for the boy into the offered hat.</p>

<p>After the collection and another shower of pamphlets,
Lorraine and her young Coldstream Guards marched off
the platform to tack up placards asking for farmerettes
and speakerettes to be pressed into service. Then Lorraine
dashed over to Thurley—nothing left of the timid
little person with a saddish look in her dove-colored eyes.
She approached Thurley as hail-fellow well-met, holding
out her hand cordially:</p>

<p>“Well, Thurley, you’ve stolen a march on us. You
would have been dragged up here to sing if I’d seen
you ... isn’t it glorious?” She paused as if uncertain
whether it was the war, the audience or Thurley’s
frock.</p>

<p>“I was going to call on you,” Thurley said gravely.</p>

<p>“Come along—I drive the car now. Yes, indeed,
I’m qualifying for an ambulance corps. Come on,
girls—this is Thurley Precore who’ll boost the subscriptions
a lot—you know these girls—Josie, Cora, Hazel—and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
Owen, you stay behind and take in the platform
and the barrel.”</p>

<p>They piled into the muddied car while Lorraine
whizzed them up the hill. Sentimental thoughts about
entering Dan’s house, which was to have once been
hers, took flight. This new and a trifle mad Lorraine
commanded all of Thurley’s attention—and sense of
humor.</p>

<p>It was amusing to see the desperate way in which she
strove to appear mannish, capable, immune to fears as to
bumblebees or punctured tires, shouting out commands
to her “crew,” the way the crew shouted back opinions
and watched Thurley and her frock in semi-envy, semi-disapproval!
They left the car before the door and
went inside in breathless fashion. Lorraine walked up
the pathway with Thurley.</p>

<p>“How can you bury yourself here,” she asked, “when
you could be speaking to crowds in New York? I’m going
to get there—I can’t go overseas because of Dan.”
She almost resented the interference!</p>

<p>“I was tired—my head was in a whirl, the season
seems a nightmare—”</p>

<p>“Oh, not personal work—the cause we women have
championed,” she opened the door as she spoke.</p>

<p>“Where is your boy?” Thurley interrupted.</p>

<p>“Oh, the love—I’ve a girl to take care of him, I
couldn’t do both my war work and the boy.” Lorraine
went upstairs, her absurd little boots tapping importantly.</p>

<p>The young Coldstream Guardesses waited below, playing
the Victrola and rummaging for a dish of fudge.</p>

<p>A frowsly headed, sullen girl met them at the head
of the stairs. “He’s bumped hisself again,” she said
by way of greeting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span></p>

<p>“Then watch him more, Herta,” Lorraine was petulant.
“Dear me, such a great lad ought to be more
steady on his feet, I should think!”</p>

<p>The disordered nursery exhibited traces of a large
lunch which Herta had consumed, a novel spread face
downward, also for Herta, and the outlines of Herta’s
recumbent form on the divan. Thurley’s face was disapproving
as she said swiftly:</p>

<p>“If I were a detective, I could explain why the Boy
bumped himself!”</p>

<p>“Oh, Herta’s mad about him,—dear me, some days
I never see him at all. He’s terribly self-willed. I
spoiled him those first months because we—we were all
so happy,” she flushed as she went ahead. “Then Dan
went away and I saw my duty as a war worker. I really
have lived in the fullest sense since I went in for public
work. Thurley, let’s be friends—I used to think I
envied you because Dan had once loved you so,” there was
a trace of the old Lorraine as she spoke, but with a
surety of opinion which told Thurley that Lorraine’s
husband now loved only his wife! “Boy made it all so
different. Now I envy you because you are free, unhampered,
able to do things—I’d be in France if I
could.”</p>

<p>Herta appeared with Boy in her arms, a splendid little
chap if he had had a little more grooming. There
were telltale hollows under his pinkish rimmed eyes indicative
of nervous spasms, of unattended or unchecked
sobs, his hands were soiled and scratched and a blue-black
bump stood out over one temple; he tried his best
both to abuse and welcome his mother in his incoherent
greeting.</p>

<p>“Oh, see his poor head.” Thurley took him from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
girl’s unwilling arms. “Didn’t you put anything on
it?” she asked her sharply.</p>

<p>“He’s got an awful temper,” the girl retorted. “He
fights me off for fair. I would have, but he didn’t want
it—so I let him cry it out.”</p>

<p>Lorraine interposed, “It is my own fault—I never
left him alone at first and it makes it hard for any one
else who looks after him.”</p>

<p>Thurley sat down to rock Boy. “I should think you
wouldn’t let a baby’s nerves be an excuse for neglecting
him,” she said to her own surprise. “He must have
sobbed and sobbed—and see,” pointing to traces of
dried and goo-ey egg around his mouth.</p>

<p>“Oh, we scrub him up at night—it really doesn’t pay
to keep him like a doll.... I want to show you my
letters of recommendation.” Lorraine vanished with
Thurley following reluctantly, Boy in her arms playing
with her sash fringe.</p>

<p>The entire house had the neglected look which the
town had prophesied Thurley’s house would have should
she marry Dan—dust over everything, unpolished floors,
a careless air of hurried living, merely existing within
the four walls in order to escape without. Herta poked
herself after them, with a look of disapproval as she
watched Thurley.</p>

<p>When Thurley refused to surrender Boy, but sat down
to listen to this new and surprising Lorraine tell of her
work and aims, mentioning Dan casually, of how surprised
he would be at her development, the young guardesses
below set up a chorus of protests and came bounding
into the room with a quick hullo to Boy and a “Mercy,
what a bruise,” settling themselves on the divan to explain
their life-work to Thurley.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span></p>

<p>Of course they were all going overseas—heavens, yes,
why Josie and Hazel had their passports and were waiting
further orders—didn’t Thurley pine to go and sing?
Fancy any one’s not going if they could ... they were
all going to keep a diary and take a camera, lots of
people had smuggled pictures through, they just knew
they had. Owen Pringle was going too—he was so
jolly and his mother was related to a senator and it had
all been arranged for him—these old fogies who said
people had better stay home and ’tend to their knitting,
who listened to them?—at least, not until it was over
... just think of the adventures, the sea trip and the
chance of being submarined, every one said there were
lots of life boats—and the chance to learn French and
the friends they would make, particularly moving picture
men. Every one said Cora Spooner was as good as
Nazimova, only she needed an introduction among the
professional set, while the ideas for Josie’s war stories—well,
all the editors would be cabling her! Josie’s
mother would have to do the housework because the help
had all gone to the munition plants and her aunt’s eyes
had failed terribly—but of course their day was over
and it was Josie’s turn to find adventures. Besides, she
would lose weight. There was an incentive—she did
hate being called Fatty at all the parties. As for Hazel
Mitchell—any one who knew what a wonderful godmother
Hazel had been to several Tommies—and
what beautiful little things she could do to make every
one happy—well, Hazel would walk in and literally
back melancholy against the ropes. Of course Lorraine
had to stay at home—but she was certainly going to
try to speak in larger cities—she wanted to be as much
of the great cause as she could be—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span></p>

<p>Despite the clatter of tongues, Boy’s dark little head
drooped wearily and he slept the exhausted sleep of a
neglected hysteric who feels the sympathetic throb of a
woman’s breast and can afford to ignore brainless chatter.</p>

<p>Lorraine took Thurley home. The lieutenants were
all to stay for tea and start out on an evening campaign.</p>

<p>“We’ll have a canned supper—and candy,” she said.
“I do think I’ve been a goose to drudge so in the kitchen—but
no more of it.”</p>

<p>“And when Dan comes home?” Thurley asked in
spite of herself.</p>

<p>“The old dear will be so used to soldiers’ fare he’ll
think mine perfection.... Good-by, Thurley, do change
your mind and give us a benefit sing. Don’t worry about
Boy, he is all right, I weigh him every week and I am
afraid I’ll lose Herta if I find too much fault—”</p>

<p>Ali Baba was working in the backyard and Thurley
fled with relief to find him busied with currant bushes.</p>

<p>“Ali Baba,” she said, stamping her foot, “look
at me—tell me, do you see war-madness in my
eyes?”</p>

<p>He leaned on his hand cultivator reflectively. “War
madness? Land sakes and Mrs. Davis, that’s a new
one—”</p>

<p>“You have seen fame-madness and vanity-madness
and lonesome-madness and even temper-madness in me,”
Thurley confessed, “but this war-madness, this way of
leaving houses undusted and babies unkissed—like Lorraine—”</p>

<p>Ali Baba left the cultivator to come forward. His
blue eyes were keen with indignation. “Thurley,” he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
said, “God bless our women that work and pray for
the boys, but I’m gosh-hanged sick of these critters chasing
around day and night trying their best to get changed
into these here semi-monjays!”</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXV</h2>

<p>When it was time for Thurley to go to New York,
Miss Clergy intimated that she would spend the winter
at the Fincherie, while the Corners said Thurley had
returned “to get cured of something,” because she had
stayed so at home and the only person in whom she
expressed an interest had been Dan Birge’s son.</p>

<p>“Oh, no, you must see me in my new opera. I’d be
lonesome for you—”</p>

<p>“Lonesome for the baby,” Miss Clergy corrected,
smiling. “There are dozens of people you can have
with you, Thurley—and I’m tired.”</p>

<p>So Thurley packed her trunks and told Ali Baba to
call her back if Miss Clergy seemed even inclined to want
her. The day before she was to leave, she wandered
along the shore of the lake, looking at the deserted
mansions with a perplexed and disapproving air. She
had found much of which to disapprove in the Corners.</p>

<p>It was the queer war-madness in such as Lorraine and
her following, destroying common sense and blinding
their eyes.</p>

<p>When this restless army returned, whether from
overseas or from home service, for return they must,
what then of the readjustment? The quiet tragedies
that would be lived down slowly, so unsuspectedly—so
bravely, really. After every one in the home town had
heard their stories and their pictures had been locally
printed—what then? They would assume the old jobs,
the maddening procedure of “Good morning, help,” and
“Good morning, boss”—the white shirtwaist on Monday<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
and the pink one on Thursday and the dark silk for
best because it is serviceable; the hall bedroom with
the respectable family who are always asleep by ten
o’clock, the ending of dreams, the failure of the quest,
the defeating admission that the circle and not the cross
is life’s truest symbol.</p>

<p>Surely these people would turn in protest to art as
their solace. What a task America had set for her, what
herculean effort Bliss must make ... for these people
would appeal to the accepted standards of art as their
defense. The plays, poems, stories, songs, pictures, useless
bohemian lives that would follow if permitted, the
refusal to become one of many—to take an interest in
the neighbors and not the enemies!</p>

<p>Thurley rose with sudden determination. Right always
ends by acquiring might, she told herself, and if
Bliss Hobart possessed a vision he, himself, was powerless
to execute it. Player and worker were like the
wings of a bird, he had said, equal and necessary ...
then so were dreamer and doer. Thurley could <em>do</em>—her
ancestors probably toddled about in sabots a few
generations ago but she thanked heaven for the sturdy,
unknown peasant strain in her which gave her the virility
to act. Hobart was the patrician dreamer—yet
even gold cannot be used in its purest state, it requires
a sterner, coarser alloy before it becomes either practical
or fully beautiful.</p>

<p>“After the boys fall out of step,” Thurley informed
the little lake, “we must fall in step—teach them to
go forth once more on a time clock.”</p>

<p>“Gray angels”—that was what the people in the
vanguard, not only the art vanguard but in all avenues
of progress, should be called,—people with enough of
the divine in them to have no fear and to believe in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>
ultimate success of their ideals, and enough of the
human sinner to understand the best earthly way to go
about it. Gray angels! The people who can do the
needed drudgery which permits others to accomplish the
toil-free feats; stay-at-homes were gray angels; the women
who did not lift up their voices in egotistical speechmaking
or in whines but who gave their sons and kept
the home in which to welcome them back; those quiet,
undersized little chaps with poor eyes or hollow chests
who had quietly applied at recruiting stations only to
be turned off with a laugh—they were gray angels, staying
at the helm to do uninteresting routine which is always
needed to keep things afloat, yet applauding those
who have achieved the apparently bigger things; and it
would be gray angels who should steady the army of men
and women who should demand: “What next? We
want another great task to do,” looking with scorn at
a clerk’s white apron, an adding machine, a modest millinery
store!</p>

<p>The gray angels dyke a nation’s forceful common sense
from becoming a flood of useless sentiment, expending itself
no one knows where, lost to practical purposes. It
would be the gray angels who would help win the violet
crown because they gauge nothing in misleading blacks
or whites, since life on this planet is not expressed in
harsh, sweeping tones, but in neutral grays, partaking of
both white and black, now foggy and bewildering, now
serene and sweetly sad with lavender veiling, or rosy
flecked and hopeful.</p>

<p>Bliss was a gray angel—Ernestine, Polly, Collin and
Caleb had the possibilities of becoming them.</p>

<p>... “I believe I’m a gray angel, too,” Thurley thought
with sudden delight.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXVI</h2>

<p>Thurley had lingered at the Fincherie until the time
grew so short she knew she must rush into her concert
work without her customary rehearsals. She had word
from Bliss Hobart that he was on his way West to speak
for patriotic matters and arrange some musical things
and he had left some music for her and advice as to a
difficult new rôle.</p>

<p>His letter did not create in Thurley the usual rebellion
against Bliss’s reserved self or her own foolish pledge.
She was too busy casting ahead for coming events, wondering
how her opportunity would arrive in which to
prove her gray angel self and best to help Bliss’s vision to
become practically demonstrated.</p>

<p>She said good-by with reluctance to Dan’s son and
his foolish, ineffectual little mother whose head was
temporarily in a whirl of excitement. Lorraine was to
face readjustment as much as the man who would return
to civilian life minus an arm. It seemed to Thurley
that perhaps here was where gray angel demonstration
must begin—to stop Lorraine’s neglect of her home
and child, and convince her that when Dan came back expecting
to find the same gentle wife whose house was
her kingdom and whose outlook on life would be his tempering
element—she must not fail him.</p>

<p>Yet Lorraine seemed beyond reason. Josie, Hazel,
Cora and Owen, with another handful of equally featherweight
mental calibre, had gone on their way rejoicing,
they had had a farewell banquet with speeches made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>
about their being “patriotic pilgrims” and had fitted
bags presented as tokens of esteem....</p>

<p class="tb">Thurley found intriguers and hysterical hikers in full
swing in the city, but it was good to have a hum of life
and progress once again. Caleb dropped in to tell of
the success of “The Patriotic Burglar” which had gone
into six editions.</p>

<p>“Have you read it?” he asked, snuggling in an easy
chair.</p>

<p>She shook her head. “What do you hear from
Ernestine? Collin wrote a postal which I found when
I came in from the Corners.”</p>

<p>Caleb laughed. “I don’t think Beethoven and Bach
will make a hit; Ernestine will pack up her music in her
kit bag and blow back ... but you ought to read my
book—it was like rolling off a log to write it—”</p>

<p>Thurley frowned.</p>

<p>“Any other time it would have been too thin to have
got by, but every subway advertises it and there is a
stampede outside the bookstores. I have raked in a
harvest.”</p>

<p>The gray angel of Thurley prompted a reproof.</p>

<p>“What’s wrong?” he demanded gaily. “You’re too
pretty to scold.”</p>

<p>“It is cheating to write drivel—when Bliss’s and
Ernestine’s ideals for you—”</p>

<p>Caleb rose. “I’m off,” he had a petulant air like
Mark’s flippant unrest. “If people want what I write,
they shall have it! We may as well have as good a
time as we can; it seems to be the main thing these days.”</p>

<p>After he left Thurley sat oblivious to telephones or
unanswered mail, forgetting the Corners and Miss Clergy
and Ali Baba’s pride as he had driven her to the station.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>
She was considering as a judicial gray angel this question
of eternally having a good time which was a cancer
spot in national common sense.</p>

<p>Now that the tide was turning rapidly towards peace
and victory, a call was being made so stupendous and
half mystical that perhaps women could best hear and
understand since their ears are attuned to children’s unworded,
sobbed wants. It was the call to declare themselves
as gray angels and to work together for the banishment
of the good time menace, to show the world,
non-fighting and veterans, that it is good to be ordinary,
to return to “life as usual” instead of staying breathless
with excitement, unjustly halo-clad, scornful of humdrum
duties and rebelling at the inevitable readjustment.
By this women should come to see things as they
are, not as they would wish them to be.</p>

<p>Dusk crept on Thurley unawares. She started up
as the maid came in to hand her a telegram. She knew
before she opened it. Miss Clergy was dead.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXVII</h2>

<p>“She went to sleep-like,” Ali Baba told her, after the
simple funeral. “She wasn’t what you would call in
pain—just sighing and calling for people dead these
forty years. She says to Hopeful, ‘The Watcher of
the Dead has seen me’—and we knew then it was the
end.”</p>

<p>“What about the watcher of the dead?” Thurley said
softly.</p>

<p>“The watcher must have some one to keep him company
and when the last one that has died has stayed
with him long enough and goes away, they do say the
watcher goes about the village looking into faces to see
in which lies the shadow of death—and he loses no
time in taking him so that he will have company. Miss
Clergy remembered the story. She went to sleep sayin’,
‘Tell Thurley—to—use—her—own—judgment.’”</p>

<p>“Ali Baba—did she—” Thurley grasped his arm.</p>

<p>He nodded. “Just like I said—‘Tell—Thurley—to—use—her—own
judgment,’—and then she looks
up at me and she says, ‘An hour’s drive, Ali Baba—not
too fast.’” His rough hand was across his eyes.</p>

<p>“Are you quite <em>sure</em>, Ali Baba, that she knew what
she was saying?”</p>

<p>“As sure as I am what you are askin’,” the old man
answered.</p>

<p>Miss Clergy’s will was dated the year that Thurley
went with her to New York. It left, requiring neither
bond nor security, everything to Thurley Precore.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span></p>

<p>But the excitement over the death and the disposal of
the fortune was increased by Thurley’s prompt use of
it. Even the war lost its prominence when Thurley
in remarkably short time gave out a statement declaring
her intentions.</p>

<p>Her contracts would be kept but after the present
season Thurley Precore was to retire for a year at least,
in which she would devote herself—secretly, she whispered,
“to being a gray angel and helping Bliss,” but
to the public she named it “to the philanthropic enterprise
which, with Miss Clergy’s money, was to be
started.”</p>

<p>She wrote Bliss Hobart as school-girlish and impulsive
a note as one could imagine, setting forth her gray
angel theories in superlative fashion, even underlining
and putting exclamation points in pairs and punctuating
sentences by a wriggling up and down mark which she
said he was to consider as “a grin.”</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Of course you’ll be rushed to death when this reaches you,”
she concluded, “but you must hear me out. Remember, I listened
to all you told me! Never could I spend all that money for myself
nor in a sense would it be right. Miss Clergy should have
lived down her disappointment, married and raised her boys to
fight and her girls to wait and serve. Why should I, stranger that
I am, use the money for personal pleasures? I will not even buy
a bankrupt title with it.” Here she drew a very large “grin”
mark.</p>

<p>“I am buying all the deserted lake houses—we have begun negotiations
for them and together with the Fincherie there will be
a little city of ex-soldiers learning new trades, forgetting empty
sleeves and wheel-chair means of travelling, shell shock, snagged
souls—all the wilful things which prevent settling down to every
day living.</p>

<p>“It seems to me, Bliss Hobart, it will always be up to one-tenth
of the world to look after the other nine-tenths—so this enterprise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span>
will not end as the tapping of crutches dies away. The soldiers
must, of necessity, come first. But there is to be a permanent
‘practical art’ colony there—to teach all who need to
be taught the thing best fitted for him—or her. (Grin mark.)
There are to be ‘hers’!</p>

<p>“Life may be shorn of fineries and extravagances and it may be
simple—but it need never be sordid and unendurable and that is
what I shall try to prove. My heart is set on having flower beds
of deep, purple violets and mignonette for the lawns, sun dials with
comforting mottoes—there will be a task—the carving of them.
I want the one before the Fincherie itself to read:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“‘And as our years do run apace,</div>
<div class="verse">Let us love God</div>
<div class="verse">And live in peace.’</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“Do you like it? (Grin mark.)</p>

<p>“I shall have huge, copper lanterns to light the roads at night,
there must be yellow ivy and gorse about the walls and cool, gray
lavender as a background for pink ramblers and yellow tea roses
and, oh, gray angel, I must have a wind screen of willows. I shall
build a great archway in the middle of the estate and a stone fence
encircling it all. Over the archway I want a thick, oak slab with
this motto cut in by a master hand: ‘God gave them a great
thing to do—and they did it.’</p>

<p>“In each house there shall be particular equipment for particular
occupations. Children’s theaters—and fine weaving—carving
of wood and ivory and copying brocades. Just see the
work to be done, the joy of it—and the pity, too! There must
be a bee farm and a poultry annex and I’ve a regular bag of tricks

<p>“For you are the dreamer and I the doer. We are, in our relations,

and see my children and give us your blessing,</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Thurley</span>.”</p>

<p>She received her answer via wire the night she returned
to New York unwillingly to sing her first concert.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Not a gray angel but white. Wait until I can say not write it.</p>

<p class="right">“B. H.”</p>

</div>

<p>All New York whispered that “the Precore voice”
was more ravishing than ever, particularly when it sang
love songs!</p>

<p class="tb">While Thurley bustled about between her season and
her remodelling of the lake colony and assembling her
new family, the original family underwent some thrilling
events.</p>

<p>Hobart was taken unawares with a fresh budget of
duties which kept him West without respite, although he
went so far as to send Thurley numerous flowergrams
and offer donations towards her Fincherie, writing notes
in which he demanded more details as to the work and
advice as to her career.</p>

<p>Polly Harris had a mysterious surprise which resolved
itself into a great success. It was not the grand opera
that Polly stubbornly dreamed of during the lean years
of struggle; without warning, she composed and had published
camp songs which roused the country to topnotch
enthusiasm. They were jingles, really, but with sincere
sentiments, a tinge of humor and a vigorous little melody—they
sprang from the depths of Polly’s loyal heart,
bravely relinquishing opera ambitions because “a song
fights as well as an army,” she decided, locking her
attic door and preparing to drudge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span></p>

<p>“I feel light-headed,” she informed Thurley when
she came to the latter’s apartment to tell all about it.
“As if I were going to open my eyes to find myself in
a dentist’s chair, following the taking of old fashioned
laughing gas while I lost a wisdom tooth! That it would
be the same ‘’ammer, ’ammer, ’ammer on the broad ’ighway’
for yours truly! Oh, don’t ask how I wrote them—how
do you sing or Bliss direct—or Collin paint?”
she added softly.</p>

<p>“Come, sit in my lap, Polly,” said Thurley suddenly.
“I’ve always wanted to have you, you’re such a featherweight
and I’m so huge. I always wanted to capture
you and make you hear me out. You don’t know how
glad I am for you and what wonderful things are ahead
for every one.” She beckoned so enticingly that Polly,
the same, unspoiled Polly in brown smock and shabby
boots, perched herself on Thurley’s knee while they talked
it all out. The Fincherie Colony and Hobart’s precious
dreams, the useless, selfish work Caleb was doing, Ernestine’s
amusingly complaining letters, Lissa’s lack of success
in finding a duke or a blue-blooded patroness,
the threat that she might have to cut her hair short
if she was really going to stay—what would become
of that lazy rascal of a Mark?—and here was Collin
giving no one a hint as to what he was doing. And
then Polly flushed and she said awkwardly:</p>

<p>“Perhaps he will come to care a little, now, Thurley—success
sometimes makes people seem different—more
desirable, doesn’t it? I know it ought not to be the
bait—but when you have cared so long—you are reckless.
Money never brings a person the real things, does
it?” And Polly began to sob, as she had refrained from
sobbing for years while Thurley rocked her in her arms,
playing comforting gray angel and understanding woman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>
all in one. They ended quite normally by a heated argument
as to whether Polly should or should not—now
that she was to be placed on a pedestal with Francis Scott
Key—wear a distinctive costume while she toured the
country and sang her songs—say a bright red sailor and
a blue cloth cape with a single line of white braid—and
didn’t she feel ashamed to make such distressing faces
because Thurley was planning a pink chiffon evening dress
for her—base ingratitude of these newly arrived!</p>

<p>So Polly toured the country in the costume Thurley designed,
singing her songs and meeting with success, while
music shops plastered their windows with Polly Harris’
latest, and news of her triumph echoed in the trenches to
startle Ernestine into cabling congratulations and Lissa
into groaning in envy. Polly was to join Bliss in San
Francisco for a spring campaign and, when she visited
Thurley at the Fincherie, she took endless photographs
and mental notes of the colony with which to regale him,
asking if there was any special message Thurley wished
him to have.</p>

<p>“How wonderfully it is coming on! How kind every
one is and workmen seem to do wonders in no time! We
shall have the last house restored by July—and tell him
we have two hundred boys here and they say they never
want to move along—”</p>

<p>“I mean personal message,” Polly interrupted.</p>

<p>Thurley shook her head.</p>

<p>“I’ll use my own judgment,” Polly added, not knowing
how dangerously near she came to repeating words
of grave and liberating importance.</p>

<p>The third event of the family happened in June when
Ernestine and Caleb met each other at the steamer pier.
Having faced reality and realized what she was not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span>
capable of doing, Ernestine was flying home in honest
haste to try to do what she felt was her duty.</p>

<p>She looked forward to meeting Caleb as the same
sentimental person who would propose to her before
they had passed down the gangway. Ernestine had discovered
that reality, while a stern friend at first, was
a sincere and lasting one. The ooze had vanished from
her scheme of things since she faced the horrors of—not
war—but of the jumblers-in such as Lissa and Mark
and the hysterical young things from Birge’s Corners.
She had even come across Hortense Quinby who was
occupied by making intellectual love to a thick-set young
private who contemptuously accepted her affection with
the excuse, “An educated dame is better than no one—but
when I get back to my girl in Harlem—” while
Hortense told herself that this Jo Carter had a soul above
being an elevator boy; his was a spirit destined to lead
men; and she tried to check his constant assault on the
King’s English and planned on being his “fairy godmother”
when he should return to America! Ernestine
had watched with disapproval the onslaught of débutantes
upon the regulars who accepted the adoration with scornful
grins and conceited smirks, allowing these delicately
bred and reared young creatures who had been so bored
or misunderstood by their families, to lavish their attentions
on them unchecked. She had seen, by way of
contrast, the capable, heroic men and women who managed
with admirable tact to suppress these feverish young
things from doing their worst and yet not allow them
to escape without a whirl at the grindstone. Ernestine
looked upon these young things as one does at straggling
boys, stray dogs and hoboes who invariably follow the
wind-up of any dignified and splendid procession, tagging<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>
after and convinced in their own minds they are attracting
as much attention as the mounted police who swish
along in advance.</p>

<p>Having looked honestly at reality and judged it fairly,
Ernestine had honestly judged of both her former and
her present self. She felt she could never return to the
unreal, intensive selfishness which she had fostered and
excused under the title of “being different”—that she
could greet Caleb in almost flapper fashion, saying,</p>

<p>“Here I am, ready to marry you! Let’s have a general
confession. First, one Caleb Patmore has never
done his best work—but he will. Secondly, one Ernestine
Christian has been a neurotic, selfish soul but she
is going to reform.”</p>

<p>Caleb met her, to be sure. But before he spoke she
knew some catastrophe had happened in his affairs. As
he piloted her to her apartment, trying to ask interested
questions, and saying that she looked fagged and he
thanked heaven she was not going for public talks,
Ernestine waited for him to speak of himself.</p>

<p>To her amazement, he would have left her at the
doorway. But she took his arm, as Thurley might have
done, in impulsive fashion and commanded him to come
inside.</p>

<p>Rather unwillingly, he obeyed, telling about Thurley
and her “rather far-fetched scheme,” and Polly’s success
and her tour of the country with Bliss who must
be “completely out of his element” boosting for this and
that and actually prophesying a near and sudden peace.
Had she seen much of Mark? How was Lissa getting
on? And where was Collin,—no need for him to rush
over to fight beside bricklayers!</p>

<p>“What has happened,” Ernestine asked. “You are
trying to lie to me—by silence. Don’t—don’t you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>
care any more?” feeling a reluctance to speak of her
own change of heart.</p>

<p>“Of course, but you can’t love a beggar,” he flung
back roughly. “You don’t mean to say that when it’s
too late you’ve come back prepared to marry a bankrupt—a
failure,” his teeth gritted together.</p>

<p>“What are you babbling of? Please don’t be like a
Henry James conversation, say it! I’ve learned to honor
directness of speech and action.”</p>

<p>“I’ll oblige you and take my leave. The damned public
is as fickle as a weather vane. They raved over my
‘Patriotic Burglar’—I made more off of it than any
three of my other books. The public couldn’t get enough
of it. And I went ahead, as I always do,” this with insolent
assurance, “on my next best seller, ‘Military
Molly’—no plot but a pretty girl, German spy and
Yankee hero—it is enough for these days—there was
to be a red, white and blue cover on it and Molly in her
nursing costume. And the firm refused it! They dared
to say the tide has turned against war fiction, people felt
reality too keenly to want imaginary woes and victories
pictured for them—they said that to me, Caleb Patmore,”
he was unconscious of his absurdity, “when my
books have made more money for them than any other
author they have. They said it was thin and I had better
take a long rest ... that an editor’s greatest need in
the world was to discover whether or not an author was
trying to kid himself and to disillusionize him as quickly
and painlessly as possible—” he tried to laugh.</p>

<p>“That is not so bad,” Ernestine said quietly, “it had
to come some time. Rest for a year and then see what
your viewpoints are.”</p>

<p>“But I’m stony broke! I never dreamed I’d be turned
down! They dared tell me the story had nothing to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span>
commend it save questionable cleverness in nomenclature....
Why, I was hard to convince when they first wrote
me; I had made some bad plays on the stock market—I
counted on ‘Military Molly’ to pull me out of the
hole and my next book, ‘The Battles of Billy Girl,’ to
get me back to where I was a year ago. I guess there
will never be any more of my books, unless some one
stakes me to publish independently and every one shies
when you hint of it ... would you, Ernestine?”</p>

<p>“Not if you were never to speak to me.”</p>

<p>He gave a half snarl, half exclamation. “You always
wanted to see me a failure! Enjoy yourself,”—picking
up his hat.</p>

<p>“Caleb, I came back because I was not needed over
there. I came back to be a real woman—and my first
job is to make you a real man. I shall marry you, almost
before I unpack my trunks, and proceed to show you
that the really great things in life are never written out;
that your firm have had the courage, no matter what
their motive, to show you the truth, and your wife is
going to see that you follow it!”</p>

<p>As he stared at her, half enraged and half delighted,
he realized that here spoke a new and rejuvenated woman
and artist combined. The clever, sallow face was blushing
prettily and there was something softly beautiful in
the dark eyes.</p>

<p>At that moment neither knew they were about to
join Thurley’s angel-band and with the gray angels not to
sing—but to do.</p>

<p>“Suppose I’m a permanent failure, grumbling and
jealous of your success and bitter towards the world at
large? You want to take such a risk? And it is a risk,
laugh all you wish and shake your head, I’m terribly done<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>
up, feel gone to bits, brain of an oyster and my nerves
are shaky—”</p>

<p>“You remind me of nothing more terrible, Caleb, than
the picture over which the world has often smiled: the
tiny lad sitting on a doorstep and murmuring in hopes
cruel relatives will overhear and be grief-stricken and
remorseful, ‘I’m going into the garden to eat worms!’
And we all know, relatives included, what a stampede
indoors there would be if some one called out, ‘But, oh,
Jack, before you do, let’s go to the circus and have pink
lemonade—’.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXVIII</h2>

<p>Thurley, Polly and Bliss Hobart were taking a turn
about the Fincherie gardens to discuss a multitude of
detail, whether or not Caleb and Ernestine Patmore,
gay deceivers to be married all in a moment and never
let any one know, would visit the Fincherie as soon as
Ernestine’s letter intimated. Why had Collin and Mark
stopped writing? Didn’t the exhibition of doll houses
for the coming Christmas market speak well for the work
being done? And if Hobart had spoken in favor of the
leather department, Polly championed the wireless school
and the brass and copper hand industries. She had
shown favoritism, as well, for she sang three songs for
those boys and only two and a half for the others.</p>

<p>Thurley drew their attention to a newly finished sun
dial. “You see,” she said, as they took chairs within
a summer house, “it is getting used to one’s self that is
the trick. We all have to do it in some way or other at
some time. I dare say if one were born with four fingers
and an extra one appeared without warning, it
would be quite a task to know how to provide for the
newcomer ... besides, they all feel it has been worth
while,” she added, turning her eager, flushed face towards
Bliss Hobart.</p>

<p>“Why hasn’t the town put up a statue of you?”
asked Polly. “Do people salaam when they meet
you?”</p>

<p>“Well, they don’t mind saying I belong to Birge’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span>
Corners—reward sufficient.” Thurley stood up to wave
a welcoming arm to a small person in flowered organdie
and a huge shade hat, who was making her way across
the lawn, squired by her todding son.</p>

<p>“I want you to meet Lorraine Birge,” she explained
swiftly. “Lorraine is my right hand man—now.” She
did not add what had happened—the awful, furious moment
when Lorraine was summoned home from public
speaking to witness the result of Herta’s carelessness regarding
Boy—the fall from the window with the fractured
arms as a result. It had banished the war-madness;
the old, gentle Lorraine, with an added strength
of purpose perhaps born of her tiny sojourn into the
world, returned for all time. With Thurley as her
“guardian angel,” she once more recreated her house
as Dan had left it—and would expect it—nursing her
child, shaking her head firmly when committees asked
when she would join them once again!</p>

<p>Lorraine hesitated when she saw the strangers, but
Boy ambled along to garrote Hobart’s watch chain and
with his fingers clutch Polly’s red hat brim so there was
no chance for further reserve and the quartette sat chatting
of the Fincherie work, and of the future art colony
soon to be in evidence until the chimes struck five and Lorraine
bundled her son under her arm and made for her
motor car.</p>

<p>“Isn’t she the wife of—of—” Polly asked curiously.</p>

<p>“Of Dan,” Thurley admitted. “She most surely is—and
we are the best of friends. Not even Dan could
come between us! We each made a mistake, and then
unmade it, and that inspired us with mutual pity and
admiration,—understand?”</p>

<p>“When are you going to sing next?” Bliss Hobart
asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span></p>

<p>“When I have time! Don’t bother me about singing.
I’m so busy and so happy that I haven’t time to
plan.”</p>

<p>Ali Baba, important in a new uniform, came across
the lawn to tell Thurley the New York train had brought
her four guests.</p>

<p>“You’ll be real glad to see three of them, and real
sorry to see the fourth,” he whispered patronizingly,
“the fourth is that artist—he’s blind!”</p>

<p>Polly sprang to her feet. “I knew it—I knew it,”
she said breathlessly.</p>

<p>It was quite true. The over brilliant, joyous eyes
faced the darkness for all time. Mark Wirth had acted
as his courier and as the trio came into the reception
room, Ernestine and Caleb stood in the background and
Collin tried to smile at them while Mark raised his hand
to suppress their exclamations.</p>

<p>“We’ve come to belong to Ali Baba’s forty thieves,”
said Ernestine, to break the silence. “We’re as tired
and hungry as four people can be. Collin has splendid
things to tell you, he is very shy about letting us know
how wonderful he has been.” Her voice broke and she
looked at Caleb to take up the burden.</p>

<p>But Caleb was staring at Collin, whose sensitive face
quivered as a woman’s does before she cries. He made
no response.</p>

<p>Hobart came and took his hand. “I’m mighty proud
of you, old man; you get yourself rested up and forget
the haughty beauties waiting to be painted in their best
togs.... You’ll have to be a sculptor in spite of yourself.”</p>

<p>“The master said, ‘All an artist needs is to trust his
eyes,’” Collin repeated.</p>

<p>“Ah, but his inner eyes—which never dim,” Thurley<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span>
corrected, coming over to kiss his cheek. “Here is
Polly waiting to kiss you on both cheeks. Why, Collin,
you’ve just come home twice as precious; that’s all, isn’t
it?—just come home.”</p>

<p>Polly stood back, afraid that his hands would reach up
to touch her cheeks and discover the tears.</p>

<p>“I want Polly,” Collin said suddenly. “Where is
she?”</p>

<p>Hobart gave her an imperative nudge.</p>

<p>“We bother Polly from being her best,” he said softly.
“Let’s clear.... Polly’s the only one to make Collin
get used to himself.”</p>

<p class="tb">In the late evening, Thurley and Mark came back
into the house, after Mark had “talked her head off”
in the garden and as she said good night, she added,</p>

<p>“To think you’re going to do something that will
make the worth-while world claim you!”</p>

<p>“If it’s really not too late to study law,” he lapsed
back into uncertainty.</p>

<p>“I’ve come to believe that nothing worth while is
ever too late, it may not be in just the way we had
planned or preferred, but if the right effort is made,
the result follows.... Mark, what wonderful things
another person’s tragedy can inspire!”</p>

<p>“It has been Collin mostly—and Lissa’s awful selfishness!
Besides, Ernestine is really human and Caleb
follows her about like a lamb. She’ll have him writing
something ripping if he’s not careful.”</p>

<p>Hobart was reading in the study and he came in to
where they were and said that Thurley was too fagged to
stay up another moment.</p>

<p>“Which means you want to talk to Mark and being
a woman, I’m a hindrance,” she laughed, slipping away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span></p>

<p>In her room, she found Polly a funny muddle of rose-colored
negligee, handkerchiefs rolled into moist little
balls, and curl papers, oddly enough! Ernestine was trying
to argue with her, but Polly’s head was among the
cushions of Thurley’s chaise longue and only smothered
sobs escaped at intervals.</p>

<p>Ernestine gave a sigh of relief as Thurley entered.
“Do make her behave! Polly dear, you must be brave,
as you used to be about your own affairs. We all know
how hard you care. We just want you to keep on caring,
and it might have been worse. Why, Collin’s soul isn’t
bruised; now Caleb’s was,” she added honestly.</p>

<p>“How did he ever marry you?” Polly managed to ask.</p>

<p>“I ordered it, as you must—mustn’t she, Thurley?
It’s her duty.”</p>

<p>Thurley slipped down beside Polly. “A gray angel
can ask a man to marry her as easily as she can knit
him a sweater,” she whispered. “Collin needs you; he
must use his talents wisely and only some one who really
will belong to him can make him prove his worth.”</p>

<p>After Polly halfway promised that she would find the
shortest, most forceful method of requesting marriage to
a blind hero who could become a sublime poet in deathless
stone and bronze, Ernestine departed to find Caleb
in a changed, softened mood in which he admitted that
when a chap witnessed such a tragedy—and such rose-colored
clouds encircling it, who saw what Thurley had
done, forgetting herself and her career, and the men
at the Fincherie quietly getting used to themselves and
‘life as usual’ all about, it made him realize what a
smashing story could be written about such real people.
Caleb had awakened to his possibility of being a vigorous
realist.</p>

<p>Thurley turned off the lights in her room and opened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span>
the window to commune with the genial moon. She wondered
if Bliss Hobart would ever be in dire need of gray
angel courtship.... The memory of Miss Clergy’s
message, “Tell Thurley to use her own judgment,”
caused the color to flood her tired cheeks ... she almost
hoped he would not—it would be so very splendid
to have Bliss Hobart plead his own cause ... she was
only a small part gray angel, she admitted, she was
mostly—just Thurley!</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXIX</h2>

<p>Thurley returned to New York in October to sing some
engagements. The public clamored for her until one
engagement seemed naturally to lead to another and after
the signing of the armistice, Thanksgiving Day confronted
her, recalling her to the Fincherie to help the celebration
to be as perfect as possible. Besides, Lorraine
had written that Dan was home, a slight heart trouble as
the reason, but otherwise the same splendid Dan, and
Lorraine was waiting to confide in Thurley all that had
happened.</p>

<p>“So you cannot be induced to stay any longer?” Bliss
asked, as she came into his studio to say good-by.</p>

<p>“I’m not as needed here as at the Fincherie—and
then, Dan Birge is home and I want to see him,” she admitted
honestly. “So don’t dare dig up another date
for me until after the New Year. I must stay at home
that long for I’m to be Mrs. Santa Claus, you see; even
he has been ousted by the new women!”</p>

<p>“I won’t see you for a long time,” he objected drolly.
“And you look to-day like the little girl of six years ago
when you explained how you wintered with the circus
and then sang hymns until I thought I had discovered the
Yogi trick of having one’s soul slip out of the body and
wander at will—that I was listening at Saint Peter’s keyhole—”</p>

<p>“So I please you,” she answered seriously.</p>

<p>“Of course. I knew you would,” his hand touched
the little idol which had always remained on his desk.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span>
“It was just that I dreaded the inevitable transition
period; so many women never rise above it to find the
gray angel part of themselves—”</p>

<p>“Ernestine did,” Thurley murmured.</p>

<p>“Ah, she is a gray angel of gray angels! Fancy her
making Caleb stop his fulsome tales and write real
things!”</p>

<p>“But she hasn’t played a concert! Must she sacrifice
her talent, too?”</p>

<p>“No, it is like anything worth while. It takes much
personal endeavor to get it started. When Caleb has
begun to wear alpaca house-coats and put bird-houses
in all his trees and talk of the uplift and vegetable diets,
Ernestine can safely scamper back to her piano and play
as she never has before.... They, too, are proving
my vision,” he added.</p>

<p>“So is Collin with his wife Polly, and Mark, so
would Sam Sparling had he been able to stay among us.
It is a simple thing to prove when you really understand
the compensations.”</p>

<p>“And Mark has proved the falseness of Lissa’s love
and—”</p>

<p>“You are talking like an old-fashioned valentine.
Dear, dear, this will never do.” She fastened her dull
red cape with its banding of fur.</p>

<p>“Don’t go, I’ve so many things to tell you. I used
to be afraid to whisper my ideas to any one; therefore,
they were useless. And now, I simply won’t allow myself
to keep an idea over night. I must tell it to you—and
have you prove it out.... Thurley, do you remember
the day at Blessed Memory when we walked to
the sea and—”</p>

<p>She looked at her watch. “I must go, Bliss, I’ve
promised to say good-by to Caleb and Ernestine and to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span>
see how much Collin has done on his statue—Polly says
it is wonderful.”</p>

<p>He escorted her to the door, but before he opened it
he said in serious tone, “Are you going to flirt with Dan
again?”</p>

<p>“Always! I adore him as I adore no one else! He
is an inspiration and a Punch and Judy show all in one,”
adding as she slipped away, “Perhaps we were talking at
cross purposes. I mean Dan junior!”</p>

<p>The night she returned to the Fincherie she gave a
concert for Ali Baba and his Forty Thieves in the newly
added community room, some of the village hearing of
the event and straying in to listen.</p>

<p>Not until the end of the programme did she see Dan
Birge and Lorraine. Impulsively, Thurley sang, “Coming
Through the Rye,” looking at them in whole-souled
friendship.</p>

<p>As the hall was clearing, Thurley flew down to find
them.</p>

<p>“Oh, Dan,” she held on to his hands, “it is yourself
for certain, I’m so terribly glad!” She read in his
dark eyes the shadow which will rest on most of those
who have fought and returned, a dangerous expression
liable to turn into haunted, ugly memories, desperate
longings and unwise impulses.</p>

<p>Lorraine wondered if Thurley read the same problem
which she had discerned even while he was kissing her
his welcome.</p>

<p>“It is mighty good to be back,” was all he said. “A
man doesn’t know what he is going to miss until it is too
late. But you’ve done a wonderful thing. Lorraine
tells me it is to be permanent.” Yet the dangerous
expression of his eyes seemed to ridicule his own
praise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span></p>

<p>“Don’t you think Lorraine looks well?” Thurley
asked to cover the pause.</p>

<p>“Yes, Lorraine is always the same, thank fortune!
The Boy is the only one who has changed.”</p>

<p>Lorraine flushed, thinking all in an instant of how dangerously
near she had come to being forever changed,
emancipated, as Hortense Quinby would have called it,
leaving her fireside untended to pursue phantoms of restless
imagination. She smiled in understanding at Thurley
as Dan began to say what a splendid overseer Ali
Baba made and how good it was to see the old town and
surely if Miss Clergy could understand, she would be
well pleased with Thurley’s disposal of her fortune. As
he talked, he rested his weight first on one foot and then
the other, his eyebrows twitching and his hands working
together and when Thurley asked as to his own condition,
he was brusque almost to rudeness in refusing to
consider it of importance.</p>

<p>“If I had only got bumped good and proper,” he
declared, “I wouldn’t mind, but I hate this sort of air
cushion, cruel invaliding of a man.... Of course you
can’t understand because you haven’t been into things.
It’s the same as a race horse sold to a cabstand and made
to trot slowly to the station with a burden of nervous
spinsters!”</p>

<p>Thurley understood the meaning of his expression and
the readjustment he must face. She mercifully let Dan
go on his way, while Ali Baba swept down on her to report
all that had and had not happened during her absence.</p>

<p>Dan and Lorraine walked home that mild November
night, Lorraine clinging to his arm until he slouched his
shoulder as if the attitude annoyed him.</p>

<p>“Does it make you tired?” she asked wistfully.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, it seems too damned civilized,” he flung back to
her dismay.</p>

<p>“Why—Dan!”</p>

<p>He halted to light a cigar before he tried to explain,
then walked with long strides and a slight scuffling of
the feet. Lorraine had to half run in order to keep
abreast.</p>

<p>“Dan, tell me, is there something you are keeping
back? I’m brave, I’m really braver than you think, I can
understand things, truly, I can, tell me—” She was
trying not to cry.</p>

<p>“Nothing more than any man has to face when he’s
been in the thick of things and returns to a two-by-four
existence. Can you go into the store to listen to women
haggle over prices and men fuss about neckties, when all
of you tingles with what you’ve seen and helped to do?
It is just that you’ve grown beyond your home town.
Yet the heart-part of you wants to come back to it and
stay loyal and content ... maybe that’s not clear—it’s
such a queer thing. We beggars moon about homesickness
and sit about campfires and almost crucify ourselves
with longing to be home and our letters promise you it
will be, ‘Home, Hoboken or hell’ by this time or that....
You’d think we’d rush home and remain one glad
grin! But we don’t. Part of us does—the heart-part
of us that demands admiring relatives—the very dearest
wife and child in the world,” he reached out to touch
her arm as he almost strode by her, “but there is another
part of us—whether wounded or not, that part is
there—the primitive part that has to be roused in order
to go over the top,—it can’t demobilize by an officer’s
command, it has to die down—slowly—just wear away,
a fretting, gnawing longing to go shoot up the town, wallow
in mud as you hike, hike, hike after some one—catch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[413]</a></span>
the some one—maim him ... maybe kill him,”
he was talking more to himself, “to have the boom-boom
of guns waken you and put you to sleep, see slaughter
about you and chaos and every universal law turned inside
out and yourself in the center of it ... and that part
will have to be conquered by every true soldier. And
who is going to help him? He’ll love home folks the
same and all the civilized comforts and fun-making—but
sometimes that other part of him will battle against being
chained back into silence. It’s the same as the call of the
East or the mountaineer’s nostalgia when he has to live in
flat country, a state of mind, Lorraine; don’t be frightened,
I shouldn’t have bothered you with it—”</p>

<p>They had reached their gate and Dan flung it open
with a clatter.</p>

<p>“Let’s sit out on the steps for awhile, will you?” he
urged. “Four walls stifle me. If I was sure of my
nerve, I’d run the car until morning through dark roads—fast
as the wind—” He gave a jangling laugh as he
settled himself on the steps.</p>

<p>“Poor Dan,” Lorraine sobbed, trying to gather all of
him in her arms.</p>

<p>“Poor little Lorraine, you can’t understand. A fine
mess I’ve been for you anyhow, first trying not to love
you, not understanding nor appreciating you; then when
Boy came and I knew your worth and my love for you
and what a splendid pal Thurley was, but just a pal, and
then the war, and now—”</p>

<p>“But I do understand,” she told him swiftly, “I do,
indeed.... Dan, you don’t know all that has happened—about
me. They’ll tell you fast enough, so let
me prepare you. When you were gone, instead of grieving
and waiting, I, too, found a primitive part of me ...
it was the women all about me that roused it, the women<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[414]</a></span>
going overseas, making speeches, parading in uniforms—and
I deliberately neglected our boy! Yes, I did! Ask
father, for he disapproved but I would not listen. It
was all something I don’t quite understand now, but a
mighty powerful something while it lasted, and it was
Thurley who taught me the lesson,” Lorraine continued
in her sweet, even voice, neither sparing herself nor
softening the details. Finally, she ended,</p>

<p>“Even now, loving you a thousand times harder and
adoring Boy, content always to be the homemaker, happy
in it, there is, sometimes, a faint longing to go forth and
do, what shall I name it? And so, I do understand your
primitive part, Dan, and I shall be patient with it....
Perhaps it was worth the making the mistake to be able
to understand you.”</p>

<p>He gathered her in his arms. “Lorraine,” he whispered,
“we both understand—”</p>

<p>So they sat like two jolly, sentimental ghosts, until
dawn filtered through dark clouds, talking as they had
never talked before, of intangible, personal doubts and
resolves, of many happy things to come and of the mistakes
which lay behind.</p>

<p>“You know the feeling, Dan! You have been big and
keen enough to analyze it,” Lorraine summarized.
“Now help other men to become used to ‘life as usual.’
Thurley calls stay-at-homes and quiet workers ‘gray
angels’ because we are considered ineffectual, simply
keeping things going. You can be a gray angel, Dan.
It’s the most peaceful feeling in the world! Help the
boys at Thurley’s Fincherie to be average men, neither
heroes nor martyrs, talk to them as only a man who is
one of them can talk,—there lies your duty and your
salvation.”</p>

<p>“I will,” Dan promised, “if you will talk to <em>me</em>!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[415]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XL</h2>

<p>The Fincherie Christmas tree had been a great success
with a Mrs. Santa Claus in a foam of tulle and lace
instead of an apple-dumpling gentleman in a red jerkin
and leather boots.</p>

<p>Every one had everything, so the rumor went, and
Thurley sang carols until she repeated “God Rest Ye,
Merry Gentlemen” for the third time and fled in self-defence.</p>

<p>Bliss Hobart had come into the Corners unexpectedly
that morning and, after Thurley’s exit, he stood up to
suggest three cheers for the Fincherie gray angel, which
were given by a happy, well fed community who began to
think about the joys of sleep.</p>

<p>Ali Baba, who had always placed Hobart high in personal
esteem, tramped over to inform him that Thurley
was in the little breakfast room of the original Fincherie.</p>

<p>Hobart moved in that direction with alacrity. He
found Thurley sorting over a bundle of letters.</p>

<p>“If you hadn’t come to the Fincherie,” she began, “I
should have come to New York to ask you what to do
with these people?” She held out some of the letters.</p>

<p>He glanced at them. “Oh, managers will badger any
one who has been a gold mine—that’s to be expected.
I, myself, was to make a faint protest about too much
retirement, but when Mrs. Santa Claus has been a real
joy spreader, it isn’t fair to harass her, is it?”</p>

<p>“None of you can bother me overly much. I’m resolved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span>
to sing just enough to make people always want
me, and <em>live</em> enough to be able to sing my best. There!”</p>

<p>“May you follow that advice! But let’s talk about
sentimental things. I always find myself slipping this
time of the year.” He sat beside her.</p>

<p>“Stoical dreamer! I’m just beginning to understand
you.”</p>

<p>“You didn’t give me a Christmas present.”</p>

<p>“You didn’t give me one,” she began.</p>

<p>But he drew a small box from his pocket and presented
it.</p>

<p>“Why, Bliss!” She was too pleased to conceal her
delight. She opened it to find a locket of palest gold with
a fine, shining chain. The locket yielded to the pressure
of her thumb and within was space for some loved one’s
face, while on the other side was made in bas relief an
enamelled violet crown.</p>

<p>“You think I—really—have—” she began.</p>

<p>“I do, and I think I really want you to marry me,” he
said very positively. “I don’t want you to answer by
quoting a half mad woman’s request made to an untutored
girl. Will you marry me, Thurley, battered old dreamer
of nearly forty who hadn’t the courage to put into execution
what he thought, who had to tell it to a gray angel
who went and did? Will you?”</p>

<p>“Let’s talk about Ernestine and Caleb’s new book; or
Collin’s statue of Polly that is so marvellous, or Mark,—did
you know he really is on the road to right? Let me
tell about Dan, how invaluable he has become to every
one in the town, saying just the right, ‘Steady, mates,’ to
the boys up here, going on in his business, loving Lorraine
a trifle harder than ever and keeping a weather eye
out for town improvements. And did you hear about
Hortense Quinby? She has killed herself—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[417]</a></span></p>

<p>“I can wait an additional ten minutes,” he conceded;
“what about Hortense?”</p>

<p>“The boy she fancied was in love with her married his
own sweetheart without delay and Hortense ended it in a
foolish, mad fashion! You know how she was—how
such women are—”</p>

<p>“Better out of the game,” Hobart commented grimly.</p>

<p>“It touches me, not the tragedy itself, but the wasted
life.... Bliss, do you know that nearly anything under
the sun can be readjusted satisfactorily if people will only
be honest regarding the facts concerning it? You call
fame the violet crown and I call the stay-at-homes the
gray angels; you say true artists are a vanguard—fine
sounding names! But there is nothing new about it, is
there? The idea of substituting one idea, theory or name
for another to act as a rejuvenation of the brain and keep
inspiration of the heart aglow began before the days of
the pyramids! It is necessary to keep interest top hole
and while the basis of it is almost hallucination and it may
tend towards madness, the advantages do outweigh the
tendencies. The name—the violet crown,” she caressed
the locket with her hands, “spurs me on to be a gray
angel and that name has comforted Polly, Lorraine,
Ernestine—and will many others. To belong to the
vanguard of civilization—what strange intoxication is
there in the title!—to battle with art-intrigues,—romantic
phrase! I could never be without it. Bliss, what
oddities human beings are—”</p>

<p>“And now, will you marry me?” he asked meekly.</p>

<p>“Lissa has failed to find a duke and the Hotel Particular
is for sale; she staked everything on winning a
title or a patroness. What will become of her?”</p>

<p>“Unfortunately life travels so much more swiftly than
justice, I am afraid she may find another loophole of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[418]</a></span>
escape ... such people often do.... But will you
marry me?”</p>

<p>“And I find myself growing as particular as Dorothy,
wife of Sir Thomas Brown, who wished her ‘shewes to
be eythar pinke or blewe,’” she continued, “for I cannot—”</p>

<p>“I will not be cheated of another moment—answer
me.”</p>

<p>“You love me, that way?” she asked gravely.</p>

<p>“All ways. Surely, Miss Clergy’s promise—”</p>

<p>“It is not that,” she admitted, “for when she died she
left me the message, ‘Tell Thurley to use her own judgment.’
It is not that.”</p>

<p>“Then what—unless you don’t love me?”</p>

<p>“A great disillusionment waits for you,” she said honestly.
“I am only a womanly hypocrite. I am not
worthy of the violet crown nor the vanguard. I’m as
simple hearted as Lorraine and far more stupid when
you come to know the real me.... I have always loved
you. I flirted only to see if it would not rouse the man
of you to protest. I let Lissa influence me, harm my
voice, color my notions, to see if you would not speak out
as ‘my man,’ not my singing teacher, my master critic....
I tried in every avenue I could, Bliss, to make you
care. Finally, you told me your vision and the greatest
joy of it was not the vision but the thought you were
sharing it with me. I told myself, ‘at last I have something
to work for, something with which I can tempt his
interest—bait for his affection’—you see? So I set to
work to live according to your ideals, not that I did not
believe it, but because you, your own self, had told me of
it and it was your fondest wish to see it realized....
Miss Clergy’s death brought me the fortune ... the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[419]</a></span>
glorious ending of the war my opportunity ... and so
on. Now you say you love me. And I love you. But I
warn you that all your visions and ideals mattered not so
much as the fact of your sharing them with me, the nearest
I had ever come to being essential to some one, belonging
to some one—as I fancied in the old circus days
when I played the bearded lady was my mother and
the animals my brothers and sisters. F-funny, isn’t it?
Well, am I altogether too disappointing—clay toes will
peep out but it is better you should see them now—not
later.” She waited his verdict, her head tilted defiantly
and the glorious, blue eyes smiling bravely.</p>

<p>He did not hesitate. “Do you know a man’s greatest
joy is to discover the one he loves best of every one is not
all gray angel, that he will not have to exist on the
heights, even though he is prepared to break masculine
precedent and do so, but a real woman with adorable
weaknesses and amusing faults, spasms of ‘intuition’ and
bothers about becoming hats and concern as to the said
man’s habit of not wearing overshoes—that she will not
scorn a broad shoulder to weep on if the cook leaves
unceremoniously, nor a bit of domination when it comes
to selecting the right school for the boy or the number of
frocks for the girl’s coming out? Now, I’ve matched
clay toes with you, most delightful lover’s game in the
world.... Let me whisper something else, Thurley; I
was growing afraid of you. I thought I had better capture
you while you were content to be merely a gray
angel lest you become the shining, white spirit of the vanguard
and such a happening be made impossible.”</p>

<p>Without waiting for her approval, he took her in his
arms.</p>

<p>Making the nightly rounds to see if the windows were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[420]</a></span>
properly fastened, Ali Baba paused in the offing. He
glanced up at the mistletoe under which he had happened
to halt and smiled with sentimental satisfaction.</p>

<p>“Land sakes and Mrs. Davis,” he chuckled, “I guess
Miss Abby was dead to rights when she left it to Thurley’s
judgment!”</p>

computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
